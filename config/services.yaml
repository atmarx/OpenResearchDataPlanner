    long_description: |
      Free tier access to our SLURM-managed HPC cluster with resource limits.
      Perfect for learning, prototyping, and small-scale computations.
      Includes access to CPU nodes and limited V100 GPU time.

      **Included with free tier:**
      - Up to 1,000 CPU-hours/month
      - Up to 100 GPU-hours/month (V100, preemptible)
      - 100GB BeeGFS scratch space (ephemeral)

      Jobs may be preempted by paid users. Best for fault-tolerant workflows.
