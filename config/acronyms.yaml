  - term: "HPC"
    expansion: "High-Performance Computing"
    short_def: "Big shared computers for research"
    long_def: |
      High-Performance Computing (HPC) refers to computing systems that
      aggregate computing power to deliver much higher performance than
      a typical desktop. HPC systems use parallel processing across many
      nodes to solve complex computational problems.
    examples:
      - "Running a genome alignment across 128 CPU cores"
      - "Simulating molecular dynamics with GROMACS"
    related: ["GPU", "SU", "SLURM"]
    category: "infrastructure"

  - term: "GPU"
    expansion: "Graphics Processing Unit"
    short_def: "Special chip that's fast for ML and simulations"
    long_def: |
      A GPU is a specialized processor originally designed for rendering
      graphics, but now widely used for parallel computing tasks. GPUs
      excel at operations that can be split into thousands of simultaneous
      threads, making them ideal for machine learning, scientific
      simulations, and image processing.
    examples:
      - "Training a neural network on an NVIDIA V100"
      - "Running CUDA-accelerated molecular dynamics"
    related: ["HPC", "GPU-hour", "CUDA"]
    category: "infrastructure"

  - term: "SU"
    expansion: "Service Unit"
    short_def: "1 CPU-core running for 1 hour"
    long_def: |
      A Service Unit (SU) is the standard billing unit for HPC compute
      time. 1 SU = 1 CPU core running for 1 hour. If you run a job on
      32 cores for 10 hours, that's 320 SU.

      Think of it like electricity billing - you pay for what you use.
    examples:
      - "A 4-hour job on 8 cores = 32 SU"
      - "A genome alignment typically uses 100-500 SU"

    expansion: null
    short_def: "Cold storage - cheap but slow to retrieve"
    long_def: |
      Archive storage is designed for data you rarely access but need to
      keep. It's much cheaper than active storage but takes hours to
      retrieve.

      Think of it like putting boxes in the attic vs. keeping them on
      your desk.
    examples:
      - "Raw sequencing data after analysis is complete"
      - "Grant retention requirements (keep for 7 years)"

    long_def: |
      Protected Health Information (PHI) includes any individually
      identifiable health information. This includes medical records,
      lab results, billing information, and even appointment schedules
      when linked to an individual.

      PHI requires HIPAA-compliant storage and handling. At Northwinds,
      this means using High-tier services with BAAs in place.

  - term: "identified data"
    expansion: null
    short_def: "Data with names, SSNs, or other direct identifiers"
    long_def: |
      Identified data contains direct identifiers (names, SSNs, email addresses,
      etc.) that can identify individuals without any additional information.

      Identified data always requires appropriate security controls based on
      the data type (PHI, FERPA, etc.).

    short_def: "Names replaced with codes, but a key exists"
    long_def: |
      Encoded (or pseudonymized) data has direct identifiers replaced with
      codes or pseudonyms, BUT a linking key exists that could re-identify
      individuals.

      **Important:** Encoded data is NOT de-identified. As long as the key
      exists anywhere (Excel file, database, filing cabinet, collaborator's
      copy), the data can be re-identified and must be protected accordingly.

      Both the data AND the key need appropriate security controls.

    expansion: null
    short_def: "Cannot be linked back to individuals"
    long_def: |
      De-identified data cannot reasonably be used to identify individuals.
      This requires EITHER:

      1. **No linking key ever existed** (truly anonymous collection)
      2. **Linking key has been destroyed** (with documentation)
      3. **HIPAA Safe Harbor** - all 18 identifier types removed
      4. **Expert Determination** - statistician certified low re-ID risk

      De-identified data may qualify for lower security tiers, but always
      confirm with your IRB for human subjects data.

    long_def: |
      A linking key (or crosswalk) is any file, database, or record that
      maps codes or pseudonyms back to identifiable individuals.

      **Critical:** As long as a linking key exists ANYWHERE, the coded
      data is considered identifiable. This includes:
      - Excel files on your laptop
      - Database tables
      - Paper lists in filing cabinets
      - Copies held by collaborators

      **Startling fact:** ZIP code + birthdate + gender can uniquely identify
      87% of the US population.

      Other risky combinations include:
      - Age + occupation + education + location
      - Rare disease + geographic region
      - Detailed timestamps + behavioral patterns

      Even "de-identified" data may be re-identifiable through quasi-identifiers.

    short_def: "De-identification by removing 18 identifier types"
    long_def: |
      HIPAA Safe Harbor is a method of de-identification that requires
      removing ALL 18 categories of identifiers (45 CFR § 164.514(b)(2)):

      1. Names
      2. Geographic data smaller than state (ZIP: 3-digit only if >20,000 people)
      3. Dates (EXCEPT year) - birth, admission, discharge, death
      4. Phone numbers
      5. Fax numbers
      6. Email addresses
      7. SSN
      8. Medical record numbers
      9. Health plan beneficiary numbers
      10. Account numbers
      11. Certificate/license numbers
      12. Vehicle identifiers (VINs, license plates)
      13. Device identifiers and serial numbers
      14. Web URLs
      15. IP addresses
      16. Biometric identifiers (fingerprints, voiceprints)
      17. Full-face photos and comparable images
      18. Any other unique identifier

      **Special rules:**
      - ZIP codes: 3-digit only if area >20,000 people; 17 restricted ZIPs → "000"
      - Dates: ONLY year permitted
      - Ages 90+: Must aggregate to "90 or older"

      **Plus:** No actual knowledge that remaining data could identify individuals.

      **Re-identification risk:** Date of birth + Sex + 5-digit ZIP uniquely identifies
      over 50% of US residents (HHS guidance).

    short_def: "Statistician-certified low re-identification risk"
    long_def: |
      Expert Determination is a HIPAA de-identification method under 45 CFR § 164.514(b)(1)
      where a qualified statistical/scientific expert certifies that the risk of
      re-identifying any individual is "very small."

      **Requirements:**
      - Expert with appropriate knowledge of statistical/scientific de-identification methods
      - Determines risk is very small considering information reasonably available to recipients
      - Documents methods and results of the analysis

      **Advantages over Safe Harbor:**
      - Can retain some identifiers if justified (e.g., month/day of dates, 5-digit ZIPs)
      - Flexible based on data utility needs and recipient context

      **Disadvantages:**
      - Requires hiring qualified expert (cost)
      - Must maintain documentation for compliance audits
      - More complex than Safe Harbor's clear rules

      Use Expert Determination when you need richer data granularity than Safe Harbor allows.

    short_def: "Statistical privacy model requiring k indistinguishable records"
    long_def: |
      k-anonymity is a statistical disclosure limitation model where each record in
      a dataset corresponds to at least k individuals in the population.

      **Example:** If k=5, each combination of quasi-identifiers (age, ZIP, sex)
      must appear for at least 5 people in your dataset. This prevents singling
      out individuals.

      **Used in:** Expert Determination de-identification, statistical disclosure control

      **Trade-off:** Higher k = more privacy, less data utility. No universal "correct" k value.

    short_def: "Electronic lab notebook (ELN) for research documentation"
    long_def: |
      LabArchives is a cloud-based electronic lab notebook used to
      document research activities, experiments, and protocols. It's
      commonly used for compliance with data management requirements.

      Note: LabArchives has file size limits (typically 4GB per file)
      and storage quotas (typically 1TB per user). For large datasets,
      use dedicated research storage and link to files from your
      LabArchives entries.
    examples:
      - "Documenting wet lab protocols and observations"
      - "Recording computational experiment parameters"

  - term: "BYOL"
    expansion: "Bring Your Own License"
    short_def: "You must provide your own software license"
    long_def: |
      Bring Your Own License (BYOL) means the institution does not provide
      a license for this software - you need to purchase or obtain one
      yourself. This is common for expensive commercial software where:

      - Your department or grant has funding for licenses
      - You have an existing license from a previous institution
      - The vendor offers individual academic pricing

      BYOL software can still run on institutional infrastructure, but
      license compliance is your responsibility.
    examples:
      - "Cadence Virtuoso with ECE department license"
      - "MATLAB with grant-funded licenses"
      - "Commercial simulation tools for funded research"
