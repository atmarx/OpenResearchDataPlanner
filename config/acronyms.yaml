  - term: "HPC"
    expansion: "High-Performance Computing"
    short_def: "Big shared computers for research"
    long_def: |
      High-Performance Computing (HPC) refers to computing systems that
      aggregate computing power to deliver much higher performance than
      a typical desktop. HPC systems use parallel processing across many
      nodes to solve complex computational problems.
    examples:
      - "Running a genome alignment across 128 CPU cores"
      - "Simulating molecular dynamics with GROMACS"
    related: ["GPU", "SU", "SLURM"]
    category: "infrastructure"

  - term: "GPU"
    expansion: "Graphics Processing Unit"
    short_def: "Special chip that's fast for ML and simulations"
    long_def: |
      A GPU is a specialized processor originally designed for rendering
      graphics, but now widely used for parallel computing tasks. GPUs
      excel at operations that can be split into thousands of simultaneous
      threads, making them ideal for machine learning, scientific
      simulations, and image processing.
    examples:
      - "Training a neural network on an NVIDIA V100"
      - "Running CUDA-accelerated molecular dynamics"
    related: ["HPC", "GPU-hour", "CUDA"]
    category: "infrastructure"

  - term: "SU"
    expansion: "Service Unit"
    short_def: "1 CPU-core running for 1 hour"
    long_def: |
      A Service Unit (SU) is the standard billing unit for HPC compute
      time. 1 SU = 1 CPU core running for 1 hour. If you run a job on
      32 cores for 10 hours, that's 320 SU.

      Think of it like electricity billing - you pay for what you use.
    examples:
      - "A 4-hour job on 8 cores = 32 SU"
      - "A genome alignment typically uses 100-500 SU"
    related: ["HPC", "GPU-hour", "ACCESS credits"]

    long_def: |
      A terabyte (TB) is 1,000 gigabytes (GB) or 1 trillion bytes.
      For context:
      - Your laptop probably has 256 GB - 1 TB of storage
      - A single whole genome sequence is ~100-200 GB

    examples:
      - "1 TB = 200,000 smartphone photos"
      - "1 TB = 30,000 4K microscopy images"
      - "1 TB = 250 hours of HD video"

      SLURM is the job scheduler used on most HPC clusters. You submit
      jobs describing what resources you need (cores, memory, time), and
      SLURM schedules them to run when resources are available.
    examples:
      - "sbatch my_job.sh - submit a batch job"

  - term: "archive"
    display: "Archive Storage"
    expansion: null
    short_def: "Cold storage - cheap but slow to retrieve"
    long_def: |
      Archive storage is designed for data you rarely access but need to
      keep. It's much cheaper than active storage but takes hours to
      retrieve.

      Think of it like putting boxes in the attic vs. keeping them on
      your desk.
    examples:
      - "Raw sequencing data after analysis is complete"

    short_def: "Automatic backups you can restore from"
    long_def: |
      Snapshots are point-in-time copies of your files, like Time Machine
      backups. If you accidentally delete or modify something, you can
