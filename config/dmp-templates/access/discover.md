## ACCESS Discover Allocation

Research computations will utilize national cyberinfrastructure resources
through the NSF ACCESS program (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination
Ecosystem: Services & Support).

**Allocation Request:**
- Tier: Discover (moderate scale)
- Credits requested: {{number service.estimate}}
- Credit limit: 1,500,000 credits maximum
- Cost: {{currency service.total_cost}} (NSF-funded, no cost to PI)

**ACCESS Discover is designed for:**
- Research grants with modest computational needs
- Campus Champions allocations
- Large classes and training events
- Benchmarking and code testing at scale
- Gateway development

**Application Requirements:**
- Project abstract describing computational needs
- One-page project description (PDF, 11pt+ font, 1" margins)
- PI curriculum vitae (CV)
- Graduate students: signed advisor letter

**Advisory Review:**
Discover requests receive advisory review from ACCESS staff to help
guide resource selection and optimize your allocation strategy.

**Credit Distribution:**
ACCESS credits are awarded in two phases: half upon initial approval, and
half after submitting a progress report. Credits can be exchanged for
compute time on various national systems (1 credit ≈ 1 core-hour).

**Data Handling:**
Data stored on ACCESS resources is managed according to each resource
provider's policies. ACCESS systems are shared national infrastructure
and are not appropriate for proprietary, export-controlled, or
personally identifiable data.

**Acknowledgment:**
Publications resulting from ACCESS-supported research must acknowledge
ACCESS and the specific resources used, per ACCESS publication guidelines.
