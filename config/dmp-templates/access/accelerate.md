## ACCESS Accelerate Allocation

Research computations will utilize national cyberinfrastructure resources
through the NSF ACCESS program (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination
Ecosystem: Services & Support).

**Allocation Request:**
- Tier: Accelerate (mid-scale)
- Credits requested: {{number service.estimate}}
- Credit limit: 3,000,000 credits maximum
- Cost: {{currency service.total_cost}} (NSF-funded, no cost to PI)

**ACCESS Accelerate supports:**
- Experienced users with mid-scale resource needs
- Consolidating multi-grant computational programs
- Collaborative research projects
- Preparing for Maximize ACCESS requests
- Science gateways with growing communities

**Application Requirements:**
- Project abstract describing computational needs
- Three-page project description addressing:
  - Research objectives and methodology
  - Resource estimates and justification
  - Computational plan and software requirements
  - Team qualifications
- PI curriculum vitae (CV)

**Panel Review:**
Accelerate requests undergo formal panel review evaluating scientific
merit and resource justification. Allow 4-6 weeks from submission to
award decision.

**Credit Distribution:**
ACCESS credits are awarded in two phases: half upon initial approval, and
half after submitting a progress report. This is the maximum allocation
available per funding award through the standard process.

**Data Handling:**
Data stored on ACCESS resources is managed according to each resource
provider's policies. ACCESS systems are shared national infrastructure
and are not appropriate for proprietary, export-controlled, or
personally identifiable data.

**Acknowledgment:**
Publications resulting from ACCESS-supported research must acknowledge
ACCESS and the specific resources used, per ACCESS publication guidelines.
