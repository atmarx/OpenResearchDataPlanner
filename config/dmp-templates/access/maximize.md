## ACCESS Maximize Allocation

Research computations will utilize national cyberinfrastructure resources
through the NSF ACCESS program (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination
Ecosystem: Services & Support).

**Allocation Request:**
- Tier: Maximize (large-scale)
- Credits requested: {{number service.estimate}}
- Credit limit: No upper limit (resource provider limits may apply)
- Cost: {{currency service.total_cost}} (NSF-funded, no cost to PI)

**ACCESS Maximize is for large-scale research activities requiring
computational resources beyond what Accelerate can provide.**

**Application Requirements:**
- Main proposal (10 pages maximum) with detailed justification
- Progress report (3 pages) for renewals or supplements
- Code performance and scaling data (5 pages)
- PI and co-PI CVs (2 pages each)
- Resource cost justification

**Review Cycle:**
Maximize requests undergo formal AARC (ACCESS Allocation Review Committee)
panel review on a semi-annual cycle:
- December 15 - January 31: Awards begin April 1
- June 15 - July 31: Awards begin October 1

Plan 3-4 months from submission to award start date.

**Credit Distribution:**
Unlike other tiers, Maximize allocations may be awarded in full based on
panel review. Renewal requests require progress reports demonstrating
effective use of allocated resources.

**Data Handling:**
Data stored on ACCESS resources is managed according to each resource
provider's policies. ACCESS systems are shared national infrastructure
and are not appropriate for proprietary, export-controlled, or
personally identifiable data.

**Acknowledgment:**
Publications resulting from ACCESS-supported research must acknowledge
ACCESS and the specific resources used, per ACCESS publication guidelines.
