## ACCESS Explore Allocation

Research computations will utilize national cyberinfrastructure resources
through the NSF ACCESS program (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination
Ecosystem: Services & Support).

**Allocation Request:**
- Tier: Explore (entry-level)
- Credits requested: {{number service.estimate}}
- Credit limit: 400,000 credits maximum
- Cost: {{currency service.total_cost}} (NSF-funded, no cost to PI)

**ACCESS Explore is ideal for:**
- Resource evaluation and benchmarking
- Graduate student projects
- Code development and porting
- Small-scale exploratory computations

**Notes:**
{{service.notes}}
{{/if}}

**Application Requirements:**
- Project abstract describing computational needs
- PI curriculum vitae (CV)
- Graduate students: signed advisor letter on institutional letterhead

**Credit Distribution:**
ACCESS credits are awarded in two phases: half upon initial approval, and
half after submitting a progress report. Credits can be exchanged for
compute time on various national systems (1 credit ≈ 1 core-hour).

**Data Handling:**
Data stored on ACCESS resources is managed according to each resource
provider's policies. ACCESS systems are shared national infrastructure
and are not appropriate for proprietary, export-controlled, or
personally identifiable data.

**Acknowledgment:**
Publications resulting from ACCESS-supported research must acknowledge
ACCESS and the specific resources used, per ACCESS publication guidelines.
