## Electronic Lab Notebook (LabArchives)

Research procedures, protocols, and experimental documentation involving
{{tier.name}} data will be maintained in LabArchives, an electronic lab
notebook platform provided through {{institution.name}}'s institutional
license with appropriate security controls.

**Notebook Allocation:**
- Number of notebooks: {{number service.estimate}}
- Cost: {{currency service.total_cost}} (included with institutional license)

**Security Controls:**
Given the {{tier.name}} classification of this data:
- Notebook access restricted to authorized personnel only
- No external collaborators permitted
- All access logged and auditable
- PI approval required for any permission changes

**Appropriate Use:**
LabArchives is used for:
- Experimental protocols and procedures
- Daily lab notes and observations
- Small supporting files and images
- Documentation of methodologies

**Storage Limitations:**
LabArchives has fixed storage constraints that cannot be exceeded:
- Maximum file size: 4 GB (250 MB via auto-uploader)
- Maximum storage per notebook: 1 TB
- Not suitable for large datasets

Large datasets, raw instrument output, and bulk data files containing
{{tier.name}} information must be stored on managed research storage
infrastructure, with references maintained in the lab notebook.

**Additional Notes:**
{{service.notes}}
{{/if}}

**Data Integrity:**
- Complete version history and audit trail
- Timestamped entries for research integrity
- Witness and signature functionality available
- All modifications logged with user attribution

**Access Control:**
Notebook access is strictly limited to authorized project personnel.
The PI controls membership with explicit approval required for each
user. All access and modifications are logged and subject to audit.

**Long-Term Retention:**
Lab notebooks containing {{tier.name}} data will be retained for the
required retention period with maintained access controls. At project
conclusion, notebooks can be exported and archived per institutional
records retention policies.
