      defense, and manufacturing. GPU acceleration (LS-DYNA GPU) dramatically speeds up large
      models. The software supports complex material models, fluid-structure interaction, and
      coupled multi-physics. Academic licenses are available at reduced rates.

      Cell Ranger is the official pipeline for processing 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell
      RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and multiome data. It performs alignment, feature counting, cell
      calling, and generates analysis-ready matrices. Required as the first step before
      downstream analysis with Seurat, Scanpy, or similar tools. Memory-intensive—our HPC
      nodes have sufficient RAM for typical experiments.
