## First Impressions

I'll be honest: when I first saw "What type of data will you be working with?" I felt a small wave of relief. That's a question I can actually answer. I have photographs. Thousands of photographs of manuscripts. That's my data.

The description says I should "err on the side of caution" if I'm unsure. I appreciate that. I'm almost always unsure about technology things, so it's nice that someone anticipated that.

But then I see "you can always adjust later with our team." Which team? Is there a person I can talk to? I would very much like to talk to a person. Rebecca used to handle all of this, and now there's no one.

The skip option says "I already know my data tier." I do not know my data tier. I don't know what a tier is. Well, I know what a tier is in general - like tiers of seating at a medieval tournament - but "data tier" sounds like jargon. I'm going to proceed with the questions because I certainly don't know enough to skip them.

**Overall first impression:** Cautiously hopeful. The tone isn't condescending. But I wish someone would just tell me what a "tier" means before we start.

## Walking Through the Questions

### Question 1: Human Subjects

> "Does your research involve human subjects?"

I photograph manuscripts. Medieval manuscripts. The people who wrote them died 800 years ago. So... no? But then I think about my graduate students. Sometimes we interview archivists about their collections. Does that count as "human subjects"? The help text says "surveys, interviews, medical records, genetic data, or any data collected from people."

Interviewing archivists about their manuscript collections - is that "data collected from people"? I suppose technically it is. But those interviews are about the manuscripts, not about the archivists themselves. I think that's different? I'm going to say "No" because my main project is just photographs of old parchment.

**Confusion level:** Moderate. I eventually figured it out, but I second-guessed myself.

### Question 4 (if I'd said Yes): Student Data

I didn't go down this path, but I'm looking at it now. FERPA is mentioned. I have no idea what FERPA is. The question itself is clear - "student education records" makes sense - but then it throws acronyms at me in the flags. What's a flag in this context? Is it bad? It sounds like I've done something wrong.

### Question 5: Government Funding

> "Is this research funded by or for a government agency?"

Yes! I have an NEH grant. The National Endowment for the Humanities. But the options are:
- "No"
- "Yes - standard federal grant (NSF, NIH)"
- "Yes - DoD/defense-related"

Where is NEH? Where is any humanities funding agency? I see NSF and NIH, which are science agencies. Does NEH count as a "standard federal grant"? I genuinely don't know.

The help text mentions "DoD, DoE, NASA, or other federal contracts." All sciences. Nothing for humanities. I feel invisible.

I'm going to guess that NEH is a "standard federal grant" because it's federal and it's definitely not defense-related. But I shouldn't have to guess. I've been a humanities scholar for 35 years and we get federal grants too.

**Frustration level:** High. This question was clearly written by someone who forgot the humanities exist.

### Question 6: CUI Check

I would only see this if I'd said DoD, but I'm looking at it anyway. "CUI" - I have absolutely no idea what this means. The question has a "Learn More" section, which is good. But the content talks about "DFARS 252.204-7012" and "NIST SP 800-171" and I've lost the plot entirely.

This is clearly not for me. Medieval manuscripts are not controlled by the Department of Defense. At least I don't think they are.

### Question 7: Export Control

> "Does your research involve export-controlled technology?"

I photograph manuscripts. They're parchment. Animal skin with ink on it. I don't think that's export-controlled technology.

But the help text mentions "ITAR (defense articles), EAR (dual-use technology)" - I don't know what either of those acronyms mean, and the brief explanations in parentheses don't really help. What's a "defense article"? Could a medieval manuscript about military tactics be a defense article? That seems absurd, but I genuinely don't know.

The "Learn More" section explains these acronyms in more detail. That's helpful. But it also says "Contact our Export Control office if you're unsure." I'm always unsure. Is that office for people like me, or only for people doing actual defense research?

**Confusion level:** Low-to-moderate. I'm fairly confident this doesn't apply to me, but I'm not 100% certain, and the language makes me feel like I'm in the wrong place.

### Question 8: Proprietary Data

> "Does your research involve proprietary or confidential data?"

Finally, a question I understand completely. My manuscript photographs are going to be published. They're not proprietary. I'm digitizing public domain materials for scholarship. The answer is clearly "No - publicly shareable."

**Confusion level:** None. This question was clear.

## The Examples

I scrolled down to look at the discipline examples. There's a "Humanities & Arts" section! Someone remembered we exist.

**L1 Examples:**
- "Public domain texts and images" - Yes! This is me!
- "Published research materials" - Yes!
- "Open-access archives" - I work in archives. Good.

**L2 Examples:**
- "Unpublished manuscripts" - Wait. My photographs are of unpublished manuscripts. Medieval manuscripts that have never been transcribed or published. Does that make them L2? Or does "unpublished" mean my own work that I haven't published yet? This is confusing.
- "Licensed digital collections" - I don't know what this means.
- "Pre-publication analyses" - This is my own work before I publish it. That's different from the manuscripts themselves. I think.

**What's missing:**

The examples don't include anything about:
- Photographs of archival materials (that's most of what I do)
- International collaboration with non-US archives (I work with libraries across Europe)
- Materials that are physically in other countries but photographed by me

My UK collaboration project has "data sharing requirements" according to my persona. But the questionnaire doesn't ask about international data sharing at all. I don't know if that matters.

Also, there's no L3 or L4 example for humanities. I suppose that's because we rarely deal with classified information. But it would be nice to have an explicit note saying "Humanities research is typically L1 or L2" so I don't worry that I'm missing something.

## The Learn More Sections

I looked at several of these.

**HIPAA De-identification:**
This is for medical data. The list of 18 identifiers is thorough but completely irrelevant to me. I don't have medical records. I have photographs of medieval manuscripts.

**What is CUI:**
This section mentions "DFARS 252.204-7012" and "NIST SP 800-171" - these are code numbers that mean nothing to me. The explanation tries to be helpful, but it's still written for people who know what a "contracting officer" is. I don't have a contracting officer. I have a program officer at NEH who sends me very nice emails about my grant.

**Export Control Basics:**
This is actually the most helpful "Learn More" section. It explains that export control "applies even to verbal discussions, not just physical exports." I didn't know that. It tells me to contact the Export Control office if I'm unsure.

But here's my concern: every "Learn More" section tells me to contact someone if I'm unsure. I'm unsure about everything. Am I supposed to contact three different offices before I finish this questionnaire? That seems excessive for someone who just wants to store photographs of old books.

**Overall assessment of Learn More sections:**
They're overwhelming. Each one introduces more acronyms and more offices to contact. I appreciate that they exist, but they're clearly written for people who have some baseline technical or regulatory knowledge. I have neither.

## Overall Verdict

**Could I complete this questionnaire?**

Probably. If I really forced myself, I could get through it. But I would second-guess myself at least three times, and I might give up when I got to the government funding question and couldn't find NEH in the options.

The questions themselves are mostly clear. It's the examples, the acronyms, and the "Learn More" sections that lose me.

**What would make it easier?**

1. **Define "tier" at the very beginning.** Before anything else, tell me what a tier is and why it matters. Something like: "A tier is a security level. Higher tiers (like L3 or L4) are for sensitive data that needs extra protection. Lower tiers (like L1) are for public or non-sensitive data like published research or historical materials."

2. **Add humanities funding agencies to the government question.** NEH, NEA, IMLS - these exist. Humanities scholars get federal grants too. Either add them to the list or add a line in the help text that says "This includes all federal funding agencies, including NEH, NEA, and IMLS."

3. **Clarify "unpublished manuscripts" in the humanities examples.** Does this mean my medieval manuscripts (which have never been published because they're 800 years old) or my own scholarly work before publication? These are very different things.

4. **Add a reassurance for humanities scholars.** Something like: "Most humanities research involving historical materials, public domain texts, or archival photographs is L1 (Low). If you're working with published or public domain materials, you're likely in good shape."

5. **Simplify the Learn More sections.** Instead of throwing more acronyms at me, have a simple explanation first, then a "Technical details" section for people who need the code numbers. I don't need the code numbers. I just need to know whether this applies to me.

6. **Make the human fallback more prominent.** There should be a big button somewhere that says "I'm confused - help me." Not just a mention of "our team" in the introduction. A real escape hatch for people like me.

7. **Add an example path for someone like me.** "Dr. Tonsley is a historian who photographs medieval manuscripts for her research. Her data is publicly shareable historical material. She answers: No human subjects, Yes standard federal grant (NEH), No export control, No proprietary data. Result: L1 (Low tier). She can use self-service storage."

That last one would help enormously. If I could see someone like me going through the questionnaire and getting a sensible answer, I would feel much more confident.

## Final Thoughts

I don't want to be too negative. This questionnaire is better than most technology things I encounter. The questions are phrased in reasonably plain language. The help text exists, even if it's sometimes confusing. The tone is not condescending.

But it's clearly written by people who think primarily about biomedical research, defense contracts, and data security in technical fields. The humanities feel like an afterthought. The examples for my field are thin. The funding question forgets we exist.

I would muddle through this questionnaire, probably select "No" for most things, end up at L1, and hope I got it right. Then I would look for a human to confirm that I didn't make a terrible mistake.

That human connection is what's missing. Not just "contact our office" buried in a Learn More section. A real, prominent, "I'm a humanities scholar and I have no idea if any of this applies to me - please help" button.

Rebecca would have known what to do. But Rebecca graduated three years ago, and now it's just me.
