# IT Workbench Review: Piper Nakamoto

> First-line support specialist walks through the Support Workbench and documents her experience.

## First Impressions

*"Oh! This is what I've been asking for!"*

When Marco first showed me how we handle plan reviews, it was all email threads and spreadsheets. Someone would email their requirements, Marco would copy things into a tracking sheet, email back with questions, wait for responses... it could take weeks.

This is so much cleaner.

## Login Experience

**What I liked:**
- Simple. Name + password. No SSO dance through five different screens.
- "For Research IT and Compliance staff" — clear who this is for.
- The indigo lock icon feels professional, not scary.

**Small note:**
- The placeholder says "e.g., Marco DeVries" — that's not Marco's name! It should say "Marco Delavigne" if we're using a real example. Or just "Your Name" to be safe.

## Empty State (No Plans Loaded)

*"Drop plan files here or click to browse"*

**What I liked:**
- The big drop zone is obvious. I can't miss it.
- "JSON files exported from OpenDataPlanner" — tells me exactly what file type to look for.
- The dotted border and upload icon are the universal "put files here" signal.

**What would help:**
- Maybe a link to the researcher-side planner? Like "Researchers export their plans from the Data Planner" with a link? So if someone asks me "where do these files come from?", I have an answer ready.

## Plans List Sidebar

*"This is where it gets good."*

**What I liked:**
- I can see ALL the plans I've loaded at once. No hunting through email.
- The status badges (Pending Review, In Review, etc.) — I can scan and prioritize.
- "$X/yr • X items" preview — I know what I'm looking at before I click.
- The compact import zone stays visible so I can add more plans without switching views.

**What I'd use for support:**
- When a researcher calls asking "what's the status of my plan?", I can:
  1. Load their plan if I don't have it
  2. See the status badge immediately
  3. Give them an answer in 30 seconds

*That's a ticket resolved. That's what I need.*

## Plan Review Screen

### Header Section

**What I liked:**
- Researcher name, email (clickable!), department — all right there.
- "Exported: [date]" and "Imported: [date]" — I can tell if this is stale.
- If they left notes, I see them immediately.

**What I'd tell researchers:**
*"The notes you add when exporting? We actually read those! Put your questions there."*

### Review Progress Bar

*"This is satisfying."*

**What I liked:**
- Visual progress. I can see I'm 3/5 items through.
- Turns green when complete. Dopamine hit.
- Marco will love this. He can see at a glance what's done.

### Item-by-Item Review

*"This is the core of the workflow."*

**What I liked:**
- Click to expand — I'm not overwhelmed by all the details at once.
- Status buttons are big and obvious: Pending, Approved, Needs Info, Flagged.
- I can see their notes AND add my own.
- "Last reviewed by [name] on [date]" — I know who touched this.

**How I'd use this:**
1. Open the first item
2. Read their notes
3. If I know the answer, mark "Approved" and move on
4. If I need Marco, mark "Needs Info" and add a note saying why
5. Collapse, move to next item

*This is so much better than the spreadsheet.*

### Cost Summary

Simple. Monthly and annual. What researchers need for grants.

### Plan Status Buttons

**What I liked:**
- Big buttons: Pending Review, Needs Revision, Approved
- One click to change status
- The PDF button appears only when approved — smart, doesn't distract before then.

**The PDF approval receipt:**
*"Generate a formal approval receipt for grant documentation."*

*This is what researchers actually need. They can attach this to their grant proposal. Official-looking.*

### Export Back to Researcher

*"Send Back to Researcher" — love the framing.*

**What I liked:**
- I can add a review summary note
- The modal shows current status and progress
- One-click download

**How I'd use this:**
1. Review all items
2. Set overall status
3. Write a summary: "All approved except storage — need to clarify HIPAA requirements"
4. Export, email to researcher

## What I Would Show Researchers

If a confused researcher asks "what happens after I export my plan?", I now have something to show them:

> *"When you export your plan, you'll get a JSON file. You send that to us. We open it in our workbench — see? Here's your plan. We go through each item, check if everything looks good, add notes if we need more info. Then we export it back to you with our feedback. You can import that file to see our notes right in the planner."*

I couldn't explain this before because I didn't have a tool to point at.

## What I'd Want Added

### Quick Templates for Notes

When I write notes, I say the same things a lot:
- "Approved. Standard allocation."
- "Need to confirm HIPAA status — please update tier if applicable."
- "Contact Marco for L3/L4 requirements."

Quick-insert templates would save me time.

### Link to Researcher's Profile

If I could see their past plans, that would help. "Oh, Dr. Rilston — she's submitted three plans before, I remember her."

### Email Integration

"Send Back to Researcher" could auto-generate an email draft with the attachment. Instead of download → open email → attach → write message → send, just one button.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

I review a lot of items. `A` for Approve, `I` for Needs Info, `F` for Flagged, `Enter` to expand/collapse. Marco would appreciate this too.

## The Enthusiasm Summary

**What I'll tell my manager:**
> *"This actually reduces tickets. Researchers can see their status. I can see their context. Reviews are trackable. Everything is in one place instead of scattered across email threads. This is what I needed."*

**What I'll tell researchers:**
> *"When you send me your plan, I can open it right up, see exactly what you need, add notes, and send it back. It's not a black hole anymore. I'll walk you through it."*

**What I'll tell Marco:**
> *"I can handle more of the reviews myself now. The straightforward ones? I'll mark them approved and you can just verify. The complicated ones? I'll flag them with notes and tag you in. Your ticket load should go down."*

## Rating

**9/10**

The missing point is for the nice-to-haves: templates, email integration, keyboard shortcuts. But the core workflow? *Chef's kiss.*

*"This is what good tools feel like. They make you feel like you can do your job."*
