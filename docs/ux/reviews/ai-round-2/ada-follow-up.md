# Follow-up with Dr. Ada Okonkwo

> Based on her feedback on AI Guidance, we're planning a HIPAA De-identification Guide. What else would she find useful?

## The Question

*"Dr. Okonkwo, you mentioned HIPAA de-identification as a gap. We're planning to build that guide. What other clinical/healthcare AI guides would be useful for your students and collaborators?"*

---

## Dr. Ada Okonkwo's Response

*"Oh, you're actually going to build these? Good. Let me think about what my students ask me repeatedly..."*

### Guides I Would Actually Use

**1. HIPAA De-identification Decision Tree** *(already planning)*
- Safe Harbor vs. Expert Determination paths
- What counts as an identifier (it's more than you think)
- Re-identification risk with AI (LLMs can infer identifiers from context)
- When "de-identified" data still needs L3 handling

**2. Clinical AI Validation Checklist**
- Prospective vs. retrospective validation
- Demographic stratification requirements
- Performance metrics for clinical decision support (sensitivity/specificity trade-offs)
- When you need a statistician vs. when you can do it yourself
- Documentation requirements for publication vs. deployment

**3. IRB Amendment Guide for AI**
- When does adding AI to a protocol require amendment?
- Language for AI disclosure in consent forms
- How to describe AI use in methods sections
- Common IRB concerns and how to address them

**4. FDA Awareness Primer** *(not a full guide, just awareness)*
- "Is this a medical device?" decision tree
- SaMD (Software as a Medical Device) basics
- When to talk to regulatory affairs
- The 510(k) vs. De Novo vs. PMA distinction
- *Not trying to replace regulatory expertise, just help researchers know when to seek it*

**5. Multi-site Data Governance**
- When data can move vs. when models should move (federated)
- BAA requirements for AI tools
- Data use agreements for AI research
- Navigating IRB reciprocity across institutions

### What I'd Skip

*"Don't try to make a 'clinical AI ethics' guide. That's too abstract. The concrete guides above will naturally embed the ethical considerations. Ethics without workflow is just philosophy."*

### Priority Order

1. **HIPAA De-identification** — Highest volume of questions
2. **IRB Amendment Guide** — Second highest, everyone's confused
3. **Clinical AI Validation** — Important for publication
4. **FDA Awareness** — Niche but high-stakes when relevant
5. **Multi-site Governance** — Advanced, but my federated learning students need it

### Format Preference

*"Decision trees are good for triage. But my students also need the 'why' — maybe a narrative version for learning, and a quick-reference version for doing? Like how you'd have both a textbook chapter and a clinical checklist."*

## Summary for Planning

Ada suggests 5 guides, prioritized:
1. HIPAA De-identification Decision Tree ✓ (already planning)
2. IRB Amendment Guide for AI
3. Clinical AI Validation Checklist
4. FDA Awareness Primer (lightweight)
5. Multi-site Data Governance

Key insight: **Decision trees for doing, narratives for learning.**
