## Initial Reaction

I printed out the User Guide because I prefer paper. I'm reading through it with my afternoon tea, and I have to say... I'm already confused and we haven't even started yet.

The guide says this will take "5-10 minutes." That might be true for someone who understands computers. For me? I suspect it will take much longer. Or I'll give up.

---

## Reading Through the User Guide

### The Overview Section

The overview says the tool helps me:
1. Select the right services
2. Estimate costs
3. Generate Data Management Plan text

Okay. I think I understand that. But what are "services"? I assume it means... computer things? Storage places? I wish it said "storage and computing resources" or "where to put your files and how to analyze them."

"Your progress is saved automatically" - this is good. I liked seeing this right away. I will definitely close the browser by accident.

### Step 2: Data Classification

Oh no. This is where it starts to go wrong.

**The table with four tiers:** I'm staring at this, and I already don't know what to pick.

- "Low: Is publicly releasable, has no restrictions" - Okay, my manuscript photos are public domain. This sounds like me.
- "Medium: Has some restrictions (proprietary, unpublished)" - Wait. They're unpublished right now. Does that mean Medium?
- "High: Contains PHI, HIPAA data..." - I don't know what PHI is. HIPAA I've heard of because of medical stuff, so that's not me.
- "Restricted: Requires special handling (FISMA, CUI, classified)" - I don't know what any of those acronyms mean.

**The tips section:**
> "When in doubt, choose the higher tier."

Now I'm really confused. Does this mean I should pick Medium because my photos aren't published yet? Or Low because they're public domain manuscripts? What IS a tier anyway? Is that like a level of security?

**The last bullet:**
> "Restricted triggers a consultation workflow—you'll work directly with the security team."

This is good! I would like to talk to a person. But I don't think I need the "Restricted" option - that sounds too serious for manuscript photos.

**What I wish this section said:**
- "A tier is a security level - how careful do we need to be with your data?"
- "Public domain historical materials = Low tier"
- Maybe some examples? "Medieval manuscript photos = Low" would have saved me five minutes of worry

### Step 3: Grant Period

This part I actually understood! Start date, end date, number of years. This is like booking a hotel room. I can do this.

The example about "$100/month = $3,600 total" is helpful. Math with real numbers I can picture.

### Step 4: Data Retention

This is where I get lost again.

"How long you must keep data after the grant ends" - okay, that makes sense.

But then: "Archive storage," "archive ratio slider," percentages...

What's the difference between regular storage and archive storage? The guide says "cheaper than active storage but slower access times." So... archive is like putting it in the attic? Regular storage is like keeping it on your desk?

I wish it just said: "Active storage = files you work with regularly. Archive storage = files you need to keep but rarely open."

The percentage slider (100%, 70%, 50%) - I genuinely don't know what I need. How do I know what percentage of my photos I need to keep? All of them, I suppose? They're photographs of unique manuscripts. I can't exactly go back to medieval France and take them again.

### Step 5: Select Services

**Deep breath.**

This section has words I don't understand in almost every sentence:

- "HPC cluster" - what does HPC mean?
- "GPU-heavy machine learning" - I don't know what a GPU is
- "HIPAA-compliant analysis" - HIPAA again, still don't need it
- "Multi-institution sharing" - okay this one is in English

**But then I see it:** "Storage Only bundle"

> "Just need a place to store your research data?"

**Yes. Yes I do. That's exactly what I need.**

This is the first moment I felt like the tool was talking to me. Not to someone who runs a supercomputer lab, not to someone who does "genomics pipelines" (what even is that?), but to me. A person who just needs to put photos somewhere safe.

**The description:** "This bundle provides high-performance research storage with automatic backups and campus-wide accessibility."

Translation in my head: "A safe place for your files that backs itself up."

Perfect. I would click this immediately.

### Step 6: Usage Estimates

"Enter your estimate (storage in TB, compute in hours, etc.)"

**Here we go. What's a TB?**

I have 5,000 photographs of manuscripts. High resolution. They're... I don't know, maybe 5 megabytes each? Is that a lot? How many megabytes are in a TB?

I've seen 500GB mentioned in other parts of the guide (that's "free" for Research Storage). Is GB less than TB? Is it half of a TB?

**This is where I would call Emily** (my undergraduate helper) or just close the tab and cry into my tea.

What I desperately need here: "One terabyte (TB) is about 1,000 gigabytes (GB), which is roughly 200,000 high-resolution photos."

With that sentence, I could figure it out. Without it, I'm completely stuck.

### Step 7: Results

I didn't make it here. I got stuck at "how much storage" and gave up.

But reading ahead: "Export Budget (Markdown)" - what's Markdown?

"Data Management Plan text based on your selections" - oh, this actually sounds helpful. It writes the grant text for me? That's the part I always dread.

## Overall Impressions

### What Gave Me Hope

1. **"Storage Only" bundle** - The moment I saw this, I felt seen. Someone understands that not everyone is doing complicated science computer things.

2. **Auto-save** - Mentioned right at the beginning. Critical for someone like me who will absolutely close things by accident.

3. **Plain language in places** - "Just need a place to store your research data?" - yes, THIS is how you talk to me.

### What Made Me Want to Give Up

1. **Acronyms everywhere** - HPC, GPU, TB, GB, PHI, IRB, HIPAA, FISMA, CUI... every single one is a wall between me and understanding.

2. **No units explained** - What's a terabyte? What's a gigabyte? How do I know what I need? I work in "number of photographs" not "number of terabytes."

3. **Tier confusion** - I read that section three times and I'm still not 100% sure if I'm Low or Medium tier. The word "tier" itself isn't explained.

4. **Assumed technical knowledge** - The guide assumes I know what "compute" is, what "storage vs. archive" means, what all these services do. I don't.

### The Moment I Would Actually Give Up

**Step 6, when I have to enter "How much storage in TB"** and I have absolutely no way to convert "5,000 photos" into "TB."

This is where Emily would find me, frustrated and close to tears, saying "I just want to store my photos somewhere safe, why is this so hard?"

---

## What Would Make This Work for Me

1. **Define every acronym** the first time it appears. Not in a glossary I have to hunt for - right there inline.

2. **Explain units in human terms:**
   - "1 TB = about 200,000 photos or 500,000 document scans"
   - "1 GB = about 200 photos"

3. **Examples for each tier:**
   - "Manuscript photos of public domain materials = Low tier"
   - "Unpublished research with collaborators = Medium tier"

4. **A help button** that says "Not sure? Click here to talk to a person" - not buried in small print, but prominent on every confusing page.

5. **Conversion calculator:** I enter "5,000 photos" and it tells me "you need about 25 GB, which is 0.025 TB - you should choose the 1 TB option to have room to grow"

6. **Less is more:** Hide the complicated options. Show me ONLY the Storage Only bundle if I pick Low tier. Don't make me see all the HPC GPU ML AI alphabet soup when I just need file storage.

---

## Would I Finish This?

Honestly? **No. Not without help.**

I would get to "How much storage in TB" and either:
1. Call Emily and ask her to do it for me
2. Email the research computing help desk and hope someone kind would walk me through it
3. Give up and continue using Google Drive incorrectly because at least I understand that

**But** - and this is important - **I got further than I would with most technology things.**

The "Storage Only" bundle gave me hope. The plain language in that description made me think "maybe I can do this."

If someone fixed the units problem (explain TB in photos), added a help button, and defined tier clearly... I think I actually might make it through.

---

## One More Thing

I just want to store my manuscript photos somewhere safe. They're photos of 12th century French psalters. They're not classified. They're not medical. They're not complicated.

**I shouldn't need a computer science degree to figure out where to put them.**

The Storage Only bundle is SO CLOSE to being perfect for me. If you can make the units understandable and add a "talk to a human" button, I think even I could finish this tool.

And if I can finish it, that means you've truly made it accessible.
