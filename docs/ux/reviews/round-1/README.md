# Round 1: Initial UX Review

**Date:** 2026-02-05

**Reviewed By:** 21 Faculty Personas (AI-simulated)

**Materials Reviewed:**
- User Guide (`docs/USERGUIDE.md`)
- Services Catalog (`config/services.yaml`) - 18 services
- Bundle Presets (`config/bundles.yaml`) - 11 bundles

---

## Purpose

This is the first round of persona-based UX review. Each persona reads the user guide and attempts to plan their 3 research projects using OpenResearchDataPlanner. They document:

1. **First Impressions** - Reactions to the user guide before using the tool
2. **Experience Log** - Step-by-step walkthrough attempting to configure their projects

## Key Themes (To Be Updated After Review)

### Common Pain Points
- *TBD after reviews complete*

### Positive Feedback
- *TBD after reviews complete*

### Missing Services Requested
- *TBD after reviews complete*

### Accessibility Concerns
- *TBD after reviews complete*

### Bundle Feedback
- *TBD after reviews complete*

---

## Methodology

Each persona was given:
1. Their full backstory (persona.yaml + narrative.md)
2. The user guide to read with their 3 projects in mind
3. The complete services and bundles configuration
4. Institutional context (campus licenses, ACCESS availability, no competing services)

They produced authentic, in-character reviews based on their:
- Technical comfort level
- Time pressures
- Current workarounds
- Project requirements

---

## Next Steps

After analyzing round 1 feedback:
1. Identify high-priority fixes
2. Update user guide, services, or bundles as needed
3. Run round 2 with the same personas to measure improvement
