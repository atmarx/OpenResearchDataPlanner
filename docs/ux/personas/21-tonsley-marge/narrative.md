# Dr. Marge Tonsley

> *"I'm a medieval historian. I study manuscripts that are 800 years old. The only reason I need 'technology' is to keep the photographs safe."*

## Background

Marge Tonsley is a distinguished medieval historian. Her work on monastic scriptoria has been cited in hundreds of books. She's spent decades in archives across Europe, photographing manuscripts that haven't been studied in centuries. She's genuinely brilliant at what she does.

Technology terrifies her. Not in an irrational way — she just never learned it, and now it feels like everyone else speaks a foreign language. Her graduate student, Rebecca, used to handle everything: scanning images, organizing files, uploading to... somewhere. Rebecca graduated three years ago.

Since then, Marge has been storing her manuscript images on her personal Google Drive. She knows this probably isn't right. She doesn't know what right looks like.

## A Day in Their Life

**9:00 AM** — Arrives at office. Avoids email until after coffee.

**10:00 AM** — Reviews manuscript photographs from her last archive trip. They're on an SD card somewhere.

**11:00 AM** — Tries to upload photos to Google Drive. Hits storage limit. Doesn't know what to do.

**1:00 PM** — Meeting with a graduate student about their dissertation. This is what Marge does best.

**3:00 PM** — Colleague mentions "the cloud" and "research storage." Marge nods and smiles.

**4:00 PM** — Emails the library asking for help with digital storage. Gets a response with five acronyms she doesn't recognize.

**5:00 PM** — Goes home. The SD card is still on her desk.

## Current Workarounds

- **Google Drive**: Personal account, hitting storage limits, probably not appropriate for research.
- **SD cards**: Physical cards scattered across her office with irreplaceable images.
- **Avoiding the problem**: If she doesn't think about digital storage, maybe it will be okay.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Medieval Manuscript Digitization (L1 Low) — Storage Only
High-resolution photographs of medieval manuscripts for scholarly study.

**Why Low tier:** Public domain materials. No sensitivity concerns.

### Project 2: Monastic Archive Collaboration (UK) (L2 Medium) — Storage Only
Partnership with a UK institution studying monastic archives.

**Why Medium tier:** Partner institution has data sharing requirements.

### Project 3: Graduate Thesis Document Collection (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Collection of documents supporting graduate student research.

**Why Low tier:** Student work and historical materials, no sensitivity.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Sarah Mitchell | Medieval liturgy, more comfortable with tech |
| PhD | James O'Brien | Diplomatic history, learning digital methods |
| Undergrad | Emily Chen | Summer research, actually helps Marge with tech |

**Tech person:** Nobody, officially. Emily helps when she's around. Sarah tries but is also learning.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Plain language**: Every single term explained in normal words.
- **Minimal jargon**: If an acronym is necessary, spell it out and explain it.
- **Simple choices**: Don't overwhelm with options. Guide her to the right answer.
- **No condescension**: She's not stupid, she's just not technical.
- **Human connection**: A way to talk to a person if she gets stuck.

### What would frustrate her?
- **Any jargon at all**: "TB," "SU," "tier" — without explanation, she's lost immediately.
- **Assuming technical baseline**: "Select your storage backend" — she doesn't know what that means.
- **Too many options**: Five choices paralyze her. Two or three she can handle.
- **Making her feel stupid**: The worst outcome. She'll close the tab and never come back.

### Key test scenarios
- **True accessibility**: Can someone with no technical background complete the wizard?
- **Plain language**: Is every term explained without assuming prior knowledge?
- **Minimal complexity**: Are unnecessary options hidden or simplified?
- **Emotional safety**: Does the experience feel supportive, not judgmental?
- **Human fallback**: Is there a clear path to getting help from a person?

## Quotes

> *"What's a terabyte? Is that a lot? I have 5,000 photographs of manuscripts. Is that a terabyte?"*

> *"Oh, it says 'storage space' and then explains that a terabyte is about 250,000 photos. That's helpful."*

> *"There's a button that says 'I need help choosing.' Thank goodness. Yes, I need help choosing."*

> *"This is the first technology form that didn't make me feel like an idiot. I might actually finish it."*
