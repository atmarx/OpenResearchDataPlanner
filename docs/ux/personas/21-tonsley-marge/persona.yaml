archetype: "technophobe"
vibe: "Distinguished medieval historian. Truly uncomfortable with technology. 'My graduate student used to handle this.' Tests accessibility and plain language at the extreme."
frustrations:
  - "Every new system assumes I know things I don't"
  - "My graduate student who handled technology graduated three years ago"
  - "I just want to store my manuscript images somewhere safe"
hopes:
  - "Something that doesn't make me feel stupid"
  - "Plain words, not acronyms"

workarounds:
  - type: "grad_student"
    description: "Former grad student (now graduated) handled all tech. Nobody has replaced them."
  - type: "personal_cloud"
    description: "Manuscripts stored on personal Google Drive, unsure if appropriate"
