department: "Physics"
title: "Professor"
specialty: "Discrete atomic modeling, molecular dynamics, LAMMPS simulations"
tech_level: "high"
years_at_institution: 18

archetype: "skeptic"
vibe: "The Linux greybeard. Compiles his own kernels. Skeptical of 'wizard' tools but secretly hopes this one is different."
frustrations:
  - "Every new system promises to be different, then wastes my time"
  - "I've written scripts that do exactly what I need — why change?"
  - "IT 'solutions' are designed for people who don't know what they're doing"
hopes:
  - "Maybe this will finally be something that respects my time"
  - "If it generates accurate budget numbers, that would actually help"

workarounds:
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Maintains a personal toolkit of SLURM submission scripts perfected over 15 years"
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Has a good relationship with the physics department IT admin (they trade homebrew)"
