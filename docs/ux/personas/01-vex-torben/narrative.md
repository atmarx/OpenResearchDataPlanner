## Background

Torben Vex came to Northwinds as a freshly minted PhD from Berkeley in 2008. He'd cut his teeth on the national lab clusters at NERSC and arrived with strong opinions about how computing should work. Over the years, he's watched a parade of "new systems" come and go, each promising to make his life easier, each adding friction instead.

He's a Linux greybeard in the truest sense — still compiles his own kernels for his home server, maintains a pristine dotfiles repository, and has SLURM submission scripts he's been perfecting since 2010. His research on high-entropy alloys has been cited over 4,000 times, and he's genuinely world-class at what he does.

The thing is: Torben isn't opposed to new tools. He's opposed to *bad* tools. He's been burned enough times that he approaches every "innovation" with healthy skepticism. If OpenResearchDataPlanner respects his time and expertise, he'll be its biggest advocate. If it condescends or wastes his time, he'll tell everyone in the department to avoid it.

## A Day in Their Life

**7:00 AM** — Torben checks overnight job completions from his phone. Two of his alloy simulations finished; one crashed with a memory error. He fires off a quick email to Welk about it.

**9:00 AM** — Office hours. A grad student needs help understanding why their LAMMPS input file isn't working. Torben fixes it in 30 seconds but spends 20 minutes explaining *why* so they'll learn.

**11:00 AM** — Faculty meeting. Discussion about "research computing governance" that goes nowhere. Torben checks his email under the table.

**2:00 PM** — Grant writing. He's putting together an NSF proposal and needs budget numbers for computing. This is where OpenResearchDataPlanner could help — if it doesn't waste his time.

**4:00 PM** — Research. Finally. Reviews simulation results, tweaks parameters, submits new jobs.

## Current Workarounds

- **Custom SLURM scripts**: A toolkit he's perfected over 15 years. Job templates, automatic restarts, email notifications. It works exactly how he wants it.
- **Physics IT relationship**: Torm in physics IT is a friend. They trade homebrew recipes and Torm gives Torben a heads-up when cluster maintenance is coming.
- **Mental math for budgets**: He estimates costs based on experience, usually pretty accurate, but grant reviewers sometimes question the numbers.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Novel High-Entropy Alloy Simulations (L2 Medium)
The crown jewel. Torben is simulating a new class of alloys with potential aerospace applications. The simulations are massive — 50,000 SU/month sustained — and the results are unpublished with potential patent implications.

**Why Medium tier:** University tech transfer has flagged this for potential IP protection. Not regulated data, but definitely proprietary.

### Project 2: OpenKIM Interatomic Potential Validation (L1 Low)
A collaboration with the NSF-funded OpenKIM project to validate interatomic potentials. All data is public, all code is open source. Classic open science.

**Why Low tier:** Literally the definition of open science. Everything goes public immediately.

### Project 3: PHYS 480 Computational Lab Archive (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Archive of student assignments and teaching materials from his computational physics course. Nothing sensitive, just needs a place to live.

**Why Low tier:** Educational materials with no IP concerns.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Postdoc | Welk Zanger | Torben's right hand. Handles cluster issues when Torben travels. |
| PhD | Samra Torvald | 4th year, working on alloy oxidation |
| PhD | Raj Pentil | 3rd year, potential validation work |
| PhD | Lix Maoming | 2nd year, still learning |
| Masters | Jordy Kimmel | Thesis on grain boundary simulations |
| Undergrad | Alex Rivero | Summer REU student |

**Tech person:** Welk Zanger handles most day-to-day cluster issues. Torben handles anything unusual himself.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Speed**: Get to the point. Don't make him click through unnecessary screens.
- **Accuracy**: If it generates budget numbers, they'd better be right.
- **Respect for expertise**: Don't over-explain basic concepts. He knows what SLURM is.
- **Useful output**: A DMP fragment he can actually paste into his NSF proposal.

### What would frustrate him?
- **Slow wizards**: "Loading... please wait..." — instant alt-tab.
- **Jargon mismatch**: If it says "service units" but his cluster calls them "core-hours", he'll be annoyed.
- **Unnecessary questions**: "Do you need compute?" Yes, obviously, I selected HPC.
- **No keyboard navigation**: He doesn't want to use a mouse.

### Key test scenarios
- **Efficiency test**: Can he complete the wizard for his alloy project in under 5 minutes?
- **Power user test**: Does keyboard navigation work throughout?
- **Budget accuracy**: Do the generated numbers match his mental estimates?
- **DMP output**: Is the generated text actually usable in an NSF proposal?
