# Piper Nakamoto

> *"The professor asked me which tier they need for their HIPAA project. I knew the answer should be L3, but then they mentioned de-identified data, and I had to call Marco."*

| **Department** | Central IT - Service Desk |
| **Title** | Research Computing Support Specialist |
| **Tech Level** | Medium |
| **Years at Northwinds** | 1.5 |
| **Archetype** | First-Line Support, Still Learning |

## Background

Piper graduated from an IT support program 18 months ago. Northwinds was her first job, and she landed in Research Computing support — a role that requires understanding both technology AND academic research workflows. It's been a steep learning curve.

She's good at her job and getting better. She can walk researchers through the Data Planner wizard with confidence. She knows the common SLURM error messages. She can explain quota policies. But the edge cases still trip her up. What tier does a project need if half the data is public and half is HIPAA? Piper doesn't know, but she knows who to ask.

Her secret weapon is enthusiasm. Researchers appreciate that she actually wants to help, even when she has to say "let me check with my colleague." And Marco appreciates having someone who listens, takes notes, and doesn't make the same mistakes twice.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:00 AM** — Logs into ServiceNow. 12 tickets overnight. Quick scan: 6 password resets, 2 quota requests, 2 job failures, 1 access request, 1 mystery.

**8:30 AM** — Handles password resets. These she can do in her sleep. Quick, satisfying, done.

**9:00 AM** — Phone call: Dr. Bramford needs help with the Data Planner. She wants to estimate storage for a new project. Piper walks her through the wizard, step by step. "Click on Calculators, then select the Genomics Storage calculator..."

**9:45 AM** — Ticket from Dr. Vex. His job failed with a memory error. Piper checks the script — he didn't specify memory allocation. She knows this one! Sends the documentation link with a friendly explanation.

**10:30 AM** — Escalation needed. A researcher wants to know if they can use OneDrive for data that's "probably HIPAA but maybe not." Piper doesn't know. Slacks Marco. He's in a meeting. She tells the researcher she'll get back to them by EOD.

**11:00 AM** — Training session with Marco. Today's topic: the tier system in depth. Piper takes detailed notes. Asks about the "de-identified but originally HIPAA" edge case from earlier. Marco explains.

**12:00 PM** — Lunch break. Reads knowledge base articles. Some are helpful, some were last updated in 2019.

**1:00 PM** — Walk-in. Dr. Tonsley (History) is completely lost. Has never used research computing. Needs help with everything. Piper patiently explains the basics, pulls up the Planner's welcome screen. "Let's start here. Don't worry, I'll walk you through it."

**2:00 PM** — Closing out morning tickets. Follows up with the OneDrive/HIPAA researcher — Marco confirmed L3 storage is needed. Researcher is not happy about the extra steps. Piper empathizes but explains the requirements.

**3:00 PM** — Complex ticket: researcher's job ran successfully but produced wrong output. Piper spends 20 minutes investigating before realizing it's a research problem, not an IT problem. Gently explains she can't debug their Python code.

**4:00 PM** — Quick Slack from Marco: "Good catch on the Vex ticket." Piper smiles. She's getting better.

**5:00 PM** — End of day. Updates the knowledge base article on memory allocation — it was unclear. Small contribution, but it might help the next person.

## Relationship with the Research Data Planner

### How Piper uses it
- **Daily walkthroughs**: Guides researchers through the wizard on screen-share calls.
- **Reference for questions**: Checks the tier descriptions when researchers ask about requirements.
- **Training tool**: Points technophobic researchers to the wizard instead of trying to explain everything herself.
- **Learning resource**: The tool has taught her about research data management as much as any training.

### What helps Piper
- **Clear, simple language**: She can read it verbatim to confused researchers.
- **Step-by-step flow**: Reduces "where do I click" questions.
- **Tier selection wizard**: The questionnaire helps when researchers don't know their tier.
- **Tooltips and help text**: Answers questions without requiring escalation.

### What trips Piper up
- **Edge cases**: When the wizard doesn't clearly address unusual situations.
- **Technical jargon**: When researchers don't understand terms, neither does Piper.
- **Policy complexity**: The tool shows requirements, but doesn't explain *why*.
- **Assumptions about knowledge**: When the tool assumes researchers know things they don't.

## What Makes Piper Effective

- **Actually listens**: Researchers feel heard, even when the answer is "no."
- **Admits what she doesn't know**: Better than confident wrong answers.
- **Good escalation judgment**: Knows when to try and when to ask Marco.
- **Documents everything**: Her ticket notes are detailed and useful.
- **Improves systems**: Updates knowledge base, suggests workflow improvements.

## Growing Edges

- **Technical depth**: Still learning the "why" behind policies and systems.
- **Confidence with edge cases**: Sometimes hesitates when she should be more decisive.
- **Complex troubleshooting**: SLURM job failures beyond the basics need escalation.
- **Policy interpretation**: Can quote rules but not always explain them.

## Relationship with Researchers

### The appreciative ones
> *"Thanks for being patient with me. I know this isn't your area, but you really helped."*

### The frustrated ones
> *"I just need it to work. I don't have time for all these steps."*

### The confused ones
> *"I don't understand any of this. Can you just do it for me?"*

### How Piper handles it
She stays calm, stays helpful, and remembers that researchers are stressed about their research, not about IT. If she can make their lives easier, even a little, she's done her job.

> *"I know this seems like a lot of steps, but let me walk you through it. I promise it gets easier."*

> *"That's a great question. I want to give you the right answer, so let me check with my senior colleague."*

> *"The wizard recommended L2 Medium for your project. Let me explain what that means."*

> *"I'm still learning too! But I'll make sure we figure this out together."*

> *"Marco taught me why we have these requirements. It's not to make your life harder — it's to protect your research."*
