department: "Environmental Science"
title: "Associate Professor"
specialty: "Climate modeling, satellite imagery analysis, regional downscaling"
tech_level: "medium"
years_at_institution: 6

archetype: "evangelist"
vibe: "Passionate about open science and frustrated by data silos. Believes all publicly-funded research should be public."
frustrations:
  - "Why is it so hard to share data with collaborators at other institutions?"
  - "Our data could help so many people if it were accessible"
  - "Paywalls and proprietary formats are holding back climate science"
hopes:
  - "A system that makes open data sharing the default, not the exception"
  - "Clear guidance on making data FAIR-compliant"

workarounds:
  - type: "personal_cloud"
    description: "Uses personal Google Drive (50GB) for sharing with external collaborators"
  - type: "grad_student"
    description: "Carlin Mendz (PhD student) has built custom data pipelines that only he understands"
