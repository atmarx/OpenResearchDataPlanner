## Background

Cris Mellendo makes immersive media. VR documentaries. AR art installations. Motion capture experiments. The work is creative, experimental, and frequently hits up against hard deadlines — film festivals don't care about your compute queue.

Cris has become an expert at scavenging. He knows every free GPU hour on campus, every preemptible queue, every student lab that's empty at 3 AM. When those aren't enough, he pulls out his personal credit card and fires up AWS instances.

It's not sustainable. He knows that. But creative production has deadlines, and sometimes you just need compute NOW.

## A Day in Their Life

**9:00 AM** — Reviews overnight renders. Two completed. Three got preempted at 80%. Restarts them.

**10:00 AM** — Lab meeting. Students present their VR projects. Everything looks great but needs more render time.

**12:00 PM** — Tries to estimate how many GPU-hours are needed for the film festival deadline. Does math. Panics slightly.

**2:00 PM** — Submits as many jobs as possible to the scavenger queue. Prays.

**4:00 PM** — Half the jobs got preempted. Considers AWS costs. Opens the pricing calculator.

**6:00 PM** — Decides to pay for burst capacity. Submits credit card. Starts cloud renders.

**11:00 PM** — Monitors renders from home. One failed. Restarts. Goes to sleep with one eye on the progress bar.

## Current Workarounds

- **Scavenger queue mastery**: Knows exactly when preemption is least likely.
- **Personal AWS account**: When deadlines are hard, money solves problems.
- **Distributed rendering**: Splits jobs across every available resource.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: VR Documentary Rendering (L2 Medium)
VR documentary about climate refugees. Unreleased footage with rights complications.

**Why Medium tier:** Unreleased footage, rights issues, pre-publication.

### Project 2: Open Source AR Toolkit (L1 Low)
Open source AR development framework for the community.

**Why Low tier:** Explicitly open source, meant for public use.

### Project 3: Student Film Archive (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Archive of student film projects from courses.

**Why Low tier:** Student coursework, no IP concerns.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Maria Gonzalez | VR documentary lead |
| PhD | James Thompson | AR toolkit development |
| PhD | Alex Tran | Motion capture specialist |
| Masters | Sarah Mitchell | Thesis on volumetric video |
| Undergrad | Tyler Brooks | Summer rendering support |

**Tech person:** Everyone. Digital media students know rendering pipelines intimately.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Burst capacity options**: A way to get guaranteed compute when deadlines hit.
- **Scavenger clarity**: Understanding the tradeoffs between free/preemptible and paid/guaranteed.
- **Cost transparency**: If he needs to pay, knowing exactly how much.
- **Emergency options**: Something for "I need 500 GPU-hours in the next 48 hours."

### What would frustrate him?
- **Only steady-state planning**: His needs are bursty, not sustained.
- **No preemptible options**: Scavenger queue saves him money most of the time.
- **Hidden costs**: If burst pricing is buried, he can't plan.
- **Slow processes**: Deadlines don't wait for procurement approval.

### Key test scenarios
- **Bursty compute**: Does the tool handle highly variable usage patterns?
- **Scavenger vs. guaranteed**: Are the cost/reliability tradeoffs clear?
- **Emergency capacity**: Is there a path for urgent compute needs?
- **GPU-focused**: Does the tool understand that rendering = GPUs?

## Quotes

> *"I love the scavenger queue. Free compute is amazing. But I also need a 'panic button' for when the festival deadline is tomorrow."*

> *"Wait, I can see exactly how much guaranteed GPU-hours cost? And compare it to the scavenger queue? This is perfect."*

> *"The tool shows that burst capacity costs 3x the regular rate but is available immediately. That's exactly what I need to know."*
