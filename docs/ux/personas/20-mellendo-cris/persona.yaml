archetype: "deadline_panic"
vibe: "Creative chaos. Scavenges compute everywhere. Needs burst capacity for deadlines. Pays out of pocket for AWS when desperate."
frustrations:
  - "I need 1000 GPU-hours by Friday and nobody can help"
  - "Scavenger queue is great until it preempts my render at 90%"
  - "I love free compute but I also need reliability when it counts"
hopes:
  - "A way to mix free/cheap compute with on-demand for deadlines"
  - "Someone who understands creative production timelines"

workarounds:
  - type: "paid_out_of_pocket"
    description: "Personal AWS account for burst rendering when deadlines loom"
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Scripts to scavenge compute across multiple systems"
