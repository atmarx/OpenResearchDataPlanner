department: "Electrical and Computer Engineering"
title: "Professor"
specialty: "Chip design, EDA tools, FPGA, ITAR/export controlled research"
tech_level: "high"
years_at_institution: 12

archetype: "license_wrangler"
vibe: "Deals with export controls and classified research. Frustrated by license server headaches. Has one project that's ITAR, one that's DOD classified."
frustrations:
  - "License servers crash every other week and nobody can fix them"
  - "ITAR compliance is a nightmare but I have to do it"
  - "The DOD project has requirements that don't fit any standard form"
hopes:
  - "Someone who understands that some research just can't use standard infrastructure"
  - "A path forward for my classified project that doesn't involve 18 months of paperwork"

workarounds:
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Dedicated workstation for ITAR work, completely isolated from the network"
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Works closely with ECE IT on license server issues"
