## Background

Jenny Woldsen has been modeling market dynamics in Excel for 15 years. Her Monte Carlo simulations have informed strategy decisions at major corporations. But lately, she's been hearing that AI is transforming everything — including business research.

She wants to explore AI. She's not opposed to learning new things. She just doesn't know where to start. What's a GPU? Why do LLMs need so much compute? Can she run AI on her laptop or does she need "the cloud"? Everyone assumes she already knows the answers, but she doesn't.

Jenny is smart, capable, and willing to learn. She just needs someone to explain things without assuming prior knowledge.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:00 AM** — Reads an article about AI in management research. Understands about 60% of it.

**9:30 AM** — MBA class. Students ask about AI tools for business analysis. Jenny deflects skillfully.

**11:00 AM** — Research time. Running Monte Carlo simulations in Excel. Takes 2 hours.

**1:00 PM** — Lunch with CS colleague. Asks about AI. Gets a 20-minute explanation that raises more questions than it answers.

**3:00 PM** — Tries to set up a ChatGPT API account. Gets confused by the pricing page.

**4:30 PM** — Gives up. Goes back to Excel. At least that works.

## Current Workarounds

- **Excel for everything**: Her simulations are complex but limited by Excel's capabilities.
- **MBA students**: Sometimes help with technical tasks.
- **Avoiding the AI question**: Easier than admitting she doesn't understand it.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Market Simulation Monte Carlo (L2 Medium)
Complex market simulations using proprietary methodology.

**Why Medium tier:** Proprietary simulation methodology.

### Project 2: AI Strategy Research (new!) (L2 Medium)
Exploring LLM applications for business strategy analysis.

**Why Medium tier:** New research direction, methodology under development.

### Project 3: Teaching Case Archive (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Collection of business cases for teaching.

**Why Low tier:** Teaching materials, no sensitivity.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Marcus Webb | Financial modeling |
| PhD | Sarah Chen | Strategy research |
| Masters | Tyler Brooks | MBA/PhD track |
| Undergrad | Alex Kim | Summer research |

**Tech person:** Nobody. Jenny's students know PowerPoint and Excel, not computing.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Educational content**: Explanations of GPU vs CPU, what AI compute actually is.
- **Business-friendly framing**: Connect technical concepts to business outcomes.
- **Gentle onboarding**: Don't assume she knows what SLURM is.
- **Cost transparency**: Help her understand what AI exploration would actually cost.

### What would frustrate her?
- **Jargon without explanation**: "Request GPU nodes" — she doesn't know what that means.
- **Assuming technical background**: The business school doesn't teach Linux.
- **No AI guidance**: She wants to explore AI. The tool should help her understand options.
- **Overwhelming options**: Too many choices make her freeze.

### Key test scenarios
- **AI newcomer**: Does the tool help her understand GPU compute for AI?
- **Educational quality**: Are the explanations actually helpful for non-technical users?
- **Business framing**: Does it connect to business research needs?
- **Gentle progression**: Can she start small and scale up as she learns?

## Quotes

> *"I know I need 'compute resources' for AI. But what does that actually mean? How much? What kind?"*

> *"Oh, there's a help tooltip that explains GPU vs CPU in normal words! I've been too embarrassed to ask anyone."*

> *"The cost for exploring AI is... actually not that scary. I thought it would be thousands of dollars per month."*
