archetype: "ai_curious"
vibe: "Heard AI is important for business. Wants to explore but doesn't know where to start. Relies on Excel and doesn't understand why that's limiting."
frustrations:
  - "Everyone talks about AI but nobody explains what it actually does"
  - "I can't figure out why my Excel macros don't scale"
  - "GPU? CPU? What's the difference and why does it matter?"
hopes:
  - "Someone to explain AI in business-relevant terms"
  - "Understanding whether I need 'the cloud' or not"

workarounds:
