department: "Medical Informatics"
title: "Associate Professor"
specialty: "Clinical ML, medical imaging AI, federated learning, de-identification pipelines, FDA software validation"
tech_level: "high"
years_at_institution: 6

archetype: "ai_regulated"
vibe: "Deep AI expertise meets regulatory reality. Knows that healthcare ML is 20% model development and 80% compliance, de-identification, and validation. Thinks most ML researchers underestimate how hard it is to deploy models in clinical settings."
frustrations:
  - "Everyone wants to 'do AI for healthcare' but nobody wants to deal with HIPAA"
  - "My models work great on benchmarks but deploying them requires FDA 510(k) documentation"
  - "De-identification takes longer than model training"
  - "I need both L1 data for public benchmarks AND L3 data for clinical validation"
hopes:
  - "Clear infrastructure separation between de-identified and identified data"
  - "Someone who understands that 'just add more GPUs' doesn't solve compliance"
  - "A way to explain computational needs in terms hospital administrators understand"

workarounds:
  - type: "manual_processes"
    description: "Manual de-identification review for every dataset before any ML work"
  - type: "separate_environments"
    description: "Completely separate machines for L1 benchmark vs L3 clinical data"
  - type: "industry_collaboration"
    description: "Uses hospital partner's secure enclave for identified data work"
