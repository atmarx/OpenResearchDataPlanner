name: "Dr. Mirk Nonanda"
department: "Computer Science"
title: "Professor"
specialty: "Operating Systems, compilers, systems programming"
tech_level: "very_high"
years_at_institution: 16

archetype: "pipeline_builder"
vibe: "Builds things from scratch. Has root everywhere. Runs his own build servers. Every student leaves his lab knowing how kernels work."
frustrations:
  - "Modern infrastructure is too abstracted. I want to see the metal."
  - "My students need to understand what's happening, not just click buttons"
  - "CI/CD pipelines require permissions I shouldn't have to ask for"
hopes:
  - "Infrastructure I can actually inspect and understand"
  - "A tool that doesn't assume I want things hidden from me"

workarounds:
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Runs his own build servers and CI infrastructure"
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Has root on several department machines 'for research purposes'"
