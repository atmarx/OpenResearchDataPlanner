## Background

Ama Rilston runs the genomics core facility at Northwinds. She sequences DNA for researchers across the university — human samples, mouse samples, bird samples, you name it. And she knows that each type has completely different compliance requirements.

Human DNA means HIPAA, IRB oversight, and NIH genomic data sharing policies. Mouse DNA from a proprietary strain means IP protection. Bird DNA from the natural history museum collaboration means open science. Ama keeps all of this straight in her head, and she spends a significant portion of her time explaining it to collaborators who don't understand why they can't just "put it on the shared drive."

She's the ideal test case for the tier selection logic because she genuinely has projects in all three standard tiers.

## A Day in Their Life

**7:30 AM** — Reviews overnight sequencing runs. Human samples on one machine, animal samples on another. Never mixed.

**9:00 AM** — Meeting with a new collaborator who wants to sequence human samples. Explains HIPAA requirements. Again.

**11:00 AM** — IRB submission for the cancer study renewal. More paperwork.

**1:00 PM** — Core facility operations. Troubleshooting a sequencer that's acting up.

**3:00 PM** — Meeting with museum partner about the bird DNA project. Refreshingly simple — everything is open.

**4:30 PM** — Updates her compliance tracking spreadsheet. Hopes she hasn't missed anything.

**6:00 PM** — Still updating the spreadsheet.

## Current Workarounds

- **Elaborate tracking system**: Spreadsheets tracking which samples are which tier and where they can be processed.
- **Close relationship with IRB**: Regular meetings to stay current on requirements.
- **Strict separation**: Human samples never touch the same infrastructure as animal samples.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Human Cancer Genomics Study (L3 High)
Sequencing tumor and germline samples from cancer patients. Full HIPAA and NIH genomic data sharing requirements.

**Why High tier:** HIPAA-covered PHI with NIH genomic data sharing policy. The most regulated project she has.

### Project 2: Mouse Colony Breeding Study (L2 Medium)
Genomic analysis of a proprietary mouse strain developed in-house.

**Why Medium tier:** IP-sensitive unpublished data. Not regulated, but proprietary.

### Project 3: Museum Bird DNA Barcoding Initiative (L1 Low)
Collaboration with the natural history museum to barcode bird specimens.

**Why Low tier:** Open science project. All data goes public immediately.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Postdoc | Dr. Marcus Webb | Human genomics lead |
| PhD | Sarah Chen | Cancer study analysis |
| PhD | Ryan Kowalski | Mouse genetics |
| PhD | Aisha Mohammed | Bioinformatics pipeline development |
| PhD | Tyler Brooks | New student, rotation |
| Masters | Emma Larsson | Thesis on variant calling |
| Undergrad | Jake Wilson | Summer research (bird project only) |

**Tech person:** Core facility staff handle sequencing operations. Students handle computational analysis with guidance from Ama.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Tier nuance**: Understanding that the same lab can have L1, L2, and L3 projects.
- **Compliance accuracy**: Getting the HIPAA and NIH requirements right.
- **Clear tier explanations**: Something she can show to collaborators to explain why their data is classified a certain way.
- **Retention variations**: Different projects have different retention requirements.

### What would frustrate her?
- **One tier per lab assumption**: Her whole job is managing multiple tiers simultaneously.
- **Compliance errors**: If the tool says "HIPAA" when it should say "NIH genomic data sharing," she'll notice.
- **Over-simplification**: "All genomics data is sensitive" — no, bird DNA for the museum is explicitly open.
- **Slow tier switching**: She needs to efficiently plan multiple projects at different tiers.

### Key test scenarios
- **Multi-tier workflow**: Can she set up L1, L2, and L3 projects in one session?
- **Compliance accuracy**: Does the tool correctly describe HIPAA vs. NIH requirements?
- **Retention variations**: Does it handle NIH genomic (10 years) vs. federal standard (3 years)?
- **Tier explanation output**: Can she show the tier justification to a confused collaborator?

## Quotes

> *"Human DNA is not the same as mouse DNA is not the same as bird DNA. Please tell me this tool understands that."*

> *"Oh, I can select different retention requirements for each project? This is already better than explaining it to people verbally."*

> *"The tier justification text is actually accurate. I can literally copy this into my IRB application."*
