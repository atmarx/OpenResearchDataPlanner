department: "Genetics"
title: "Professor"
specialty: "DNA sequencing, genomics, core facility director"
tech_level: "medium"
years_at_institution: 12

archetype: "compliance_expert"
vibe: "Runs a sequencing core facility. Processes human, mouse, and bird DNA. Knows compliance requirements cold. Has projects in all three standard tiers."
frustrations:
  - "People don't understand that human DNA and mouse DNA require completely different handling"
  - "IRB requirements keep changing and I have to keep up"
  - "I spend more time on compliance paperwork than on actual science"
hopes:
  - "A tool that understands the nuance between different data types"
  - "Something that helps me explain requirements to my collaborators"

workarounds:
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Works closely with genetics IT and IRB office"
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Elaborate tracking system for which samples go where"
