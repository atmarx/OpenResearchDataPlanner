# Dr. Kev Bontamo

## At a Glance

## Background

Kev Bontamo is a fixture in the engineering building. Twenty-two years at Northwinds, hundreds of papers, generations of students trained. He started his career writing FORTRAN code on punch cards (he insists) and has evolved with the technology — but he's never forgotten the fundamentals.

His simulations are massive: composite failure modes that require tens of thousands of core-hours. He knows exactly how much compute he needs, exactly how much storage, and exactly what it should cost. He's often annoyed that nobody else seems to know these numbers as well as he does.

Kev isn't opposed to new tools — he just demands they respect his expertise. If OpenResearchDataPlanner treats him like a novice who needs guidance on basic concepts, he'll close the tab. If it gets out of his way and gives him the numbers he needs, he'll recommend it to his colleagues.

## A Day in Their Life

**6:00 AM** — Kev checks overnight jobs from home. Everything finished normally. Good.

**8:00 AM** — In the office before anyone else. Reviews simulation results, identifies parameter adjustments needed.

**9:00 AM** — Student meeting. Goes over their finite element mesh. It's wrong. Kev explains why with barely concealed impatience.

**11:00 AM** — Call with aerospace company sponsor. They want results faster. Kev explains compute constraints. Again.

**1:00 PM** — Submits next batch of jobs. His SLURM scripts handle everything automatically.

**3:00 PM** — Grant writing. NSF wants a detailed computational plan. Kev can write this in his sleep.

**5:00 PM** — Faculty meeting about "research computing governance." Kev has opinions. Shares them. Loudly.

## Current Workarounds

- **20 years of scripts**: His FORTRAN code and SLURM wrappers are battle-tested. They work.
- **Mental database**: Kev knows exactly how much compute his jobs need because he's been tracking it for decades.
- **Engineering IT ally**: He's on a first-name basis with engineering IT and often helps them debug cluster issues.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Composite Failure Mode Simulation (L2 Medium)
Industry-sponsored research modeling how composite materials fail under stress. The aerospace company has strict NDA requirements.

**Why Medium tier:** Industry NDA. All simulation results are proprietary until cleared for publication.

### Project 2: NSF CAREER: Multiscale Modeling (L2 Medium)
His CAREER award research on bridging atomic-scale and continuum-scale simulations. Highly competitive field.

**Why Medium tier:** Pre-publication research in a competitive field. Wants to control access until publication.

### Project 3: Published Simulation Validation Suite (L1 Low) — Storage Only
A benchmark dataset for the community to validate their simulation codes against. Fully public.

**Why Low tier:** Explicitly public. The purpose is reproducibility.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Postdoc | Dr. Samira Koltz | Leads the industry project |
| PhD | Marcus Webber | 4th year, multiscale modeling |
| PhD | Ling Tanveer | 3rd year, failure analysis |
| PhD | Rashid Kolm | 2nd year, learning the ropes |
| PhD | Priya Nordstrom | 1st year, background in physics |
| Undergrad | Jake Willins | Senior thesis on mesh generation |

**Tech person:** Kev himself. He's probably more qualified than most of IT.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Efficiency**: No unnecessary screens. No tutorials. Get to the point.
- **Accuracy**: Numbers that match his mental calculations (or better).
- **Respect**: The tool should assume he knows what SLURM is.
- **Power user features**: Keyboard shortcuts, bulk entry options, saved templates.

### What would frustrate him?
- **Hand-holding**: "What is High Performance Computing?" — he'll close the tab.
- **Slow loading**: Any perceptible delay is unacceptable.
- **Mouse-only navigation**: He wants to tab through fields.
- **Incorrect calculations**: If the budget numbers are wrong, he'll never trust it again.

### Key test scenarios
- **Speed run**: Can he complete the wizard for a known project in under 3 minutes?
- **Budget accuracy**: Do the generated numbers match his manual calculations?
- **Power user test**: Full keyboard navigation throughout?
- **Large compute**: Does 80,000 SU/month work correctly?

## Quotes

> *"I don't need an explanation of what SLURM is. I need to know how much 80,000 service units costs this year."*

> *"Fine, I'll try it. ...huh. That's actually the right number. First time a tool has gotten that right."*

> *"Can I save this as a template? I submit the same grant every three years."*
