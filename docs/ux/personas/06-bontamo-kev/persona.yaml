name: "Dr. Kev Bontamo"
department: "Materials Science and Engineering"
title: "Professor"
specialty: "Finite element analysis, composite materials, SLURM batch computing"
tech_level: "high"
years_at_institution: 22

archetype: "veteran"
vibe: "Grew up on FORTRAN. Runs massive batch jobs. Impatient with GUIs. Knows exactly what he needs and how much it should cost."
frustrations:
  - "New tools always add clicks between me and my simulations"
  - "I've been running these jobs for 20 years. I don't need a tutorial."
  - "Why does everyone assume I need help? I need resources, not hand-holding."
hopes:
  - "A tool that respects that I know what I'm doing"
  - "Accurate budget numbers without jumping through hoops"

workarounds:
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "FORTRAN code and SLURM wrapper scripts he's maintained for 20 years"
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Close relationship with engineering IT, often helps them debug cluster issues"
