archetype: "legacy"
vibe: "Night owl who's dealt with petabytes since before 'big data' was a thing. Has 'solved' storage with external drives. Knows this is bad but hasn't had time to fix it."
frustrations:
  - "I have 8 external drives in my office and one failed last month"
  - "There's data from 2003 that I can't access because the format is obsolete"
  - "Every time I ask IT for help, they say 'submit a ticket' and nothing happens"
hopes:
  - "A real solution for archiving decades of observations"
  - "Someone to finally take data storage seriously"

workarounds:
  - type: "external_drives"
    description: "8 external drives in his office, one failed recently causing minor data loss"
  - type: "closet_nas"
    description: "Has a consumer NAS that his former grad student set up, nobody knows the password"
