## Background

Jort Gobleson has been at Northwinds for 15 years. He started when "big data" wasn't a term yet, but he was already dealing with terabytes of telescope imagery. Over the years, his data has grown and grown, and his solutions have been... creative.

His office looks like a data center had a nervous breakdown. External drives are stacked on shelves, under his desk, next to the coffee maker. A consumer NAS hums in the corner — his former grad student set it up in 2016, and Jort isn't entirely sure how to log into it. One of his external drives failed last month, and he only found out because a student needed data for their thesis defense.

Jort knows this is bad. He's not delusional. He's just been too busy observing, publishing, teaching, and mentoring to fix it. Every time he asks IT for help, they say "submit a ticket" and nothing ever happens. He's given up on institutional solutions.

## A Day in Their Life

**3:00 AM** — Remote observing session. Jort is at home monitoring the telescope feed. New transient candidate! He triggers follow-up observations.

**7:00 AM** — Catches a few hours of sleep.

**11:00 AM** — Arrives at office. Last night's data is downloading to... which drive has space? He checks three before finding one.

**1:00 PM** — Grad student meeting. They're trying to access observations from 2008. The data exists, but the format is obsolete and the drive it's on makes clicking sounds when accessed.

**3:00 PM** — Seminar. Jort presents preliminary results but is nervous because the underlying data is in a precarious state.

**5:00 PM** — Emails IT asking about archive solutions. Receives auto-reply about ticket queue times.

## Current Workarounds

- **External drives**: 8 of them, various ages and capacities. Labeled with masking tape. One failed recently.
- **Consumer NAS**: A former student set it up. It works, but Jort doesn't have admin credentials.
- **Hope**: Not really a workaround, but Jort hopes the drives don't fail before he retires.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Transient Survey Pipeline (L2 Medium)
The active research: detecting and classifying transient astronomical events. Competitive field where getting scooped is a real concern.

**Why Medium tier:** Unpublished data in a competitive field. Not regulated, but definitely wants to control access until publication.

### Project 2: Legacy Observation Archive (1998-2015) (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Decades of historical observations that are already published. Invaluable for long-baseline studies but currently scattered across failing hardware.

**Why Low tier:** Already published, no sensitivity. The goal is preservation and accessibility.

### Project 3: Citizen Science Image Classification (L1 Low)
A public engagement project where volunteers help classify galaxy images. All data is meant to be shared.

**Why Low tier:** Explicitly public project designed for open participation.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Kellan Morst | 4th year, thesis on transient classification |
| PhD | Suki Wrenford | 2nd year, working on pipeline improvements |
| Masters | Tam Brisley | Thesis on citizen science validation |
| Undergrad | Penny Doltz | Summer research, image processing |

**Tech person:** Nobody. Jort has "always just figured it out." This is starting to catch up with him.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Acknowledgment of legacy data**: The tool should help him plan for existing data, not just new projects.
- **Archive solutions**: Clear path to get his data off those external drives.
- **Honest pricing**: Even if it's expensive, he needs to know the real cost to make the case.
- **No judgment**: He knows his setup is bad. He doesn't need the tool to lecture him.

### What would frustrate him?
- **Only forward-looking**: If the tool only helps with new projects, it misses his biggest need.
- **Assuming good practices**: "Where is your data currently stored?" — on external drives, okay? Don't make him feel worse.
- **Complex migration paths**: He needs simple steps, not a 12-step process.
- **Dismissive of scale**: 30TB of legacy data is real. The tool shouldn't blink.

### Key test scenarios
- **Legacy data**: Can he plan for archiving 30TB of existing observations?
- **Gentle guidance**: Does the tool help him toward better practices without judgment?
- **Real costs**: Does he finally understand what proper storage actually costs?
- **Multi-project**: He has active research AND legacy archive needs. Does the tool handle both?

> *"I know, I know. External drives aren't a backup strategy. But have you tried getting help from IT?"*

> *"Wait, I can request archive storage for data I already have? This isn't just for new grants?"*

> *"Thirty terabytes of archive is going to cost... okay, that's actually less than I feared. Where do I sign?"*
