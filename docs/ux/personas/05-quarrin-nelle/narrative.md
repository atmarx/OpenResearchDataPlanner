## At a Glance

| | |
|---|---|

| **Tech Level** | Low-Medium |
| **Lab Size** | 5 students |
| **Archetype** | Overwhelmed Clinician |

## Background

Nelle Quarrin is a clinician-scientist, which means she's perpetually exhausted. She splits her time between seeing patients in the memory clinic, running her research lab, teaching, and serving on approximately 400 committees (it feels like). Her research on Alzheimer's biomarkers could genuinely help people, which is why she keeps doing it despite the burnout.

The problem is: she has no bandwidth for technical details. Her former grad student, Mika, set up their fMRI analysis pipeline three years ago. Mika graduated last year. The pipeline still runs, but when it breaks, nobody knows how to fix it. Nelle doesn't have time to learn, and her current students are too junior.

She works with HIPAA-covered patient data, which she takes seriously but finds overwhelming. The compliance requirements seem designed to punish researchers for trying to help people.

## A Day in Their Life

**7:30 AM** — Arrives early to squeeze in email before clinic. Fifty-three unread messages.

**8:00 AM** — Morning clinic. Four patients, three hours. Emotionally draining.

**11:30 AM** — Fifteen-minute break. Scarfs down a granola bar while checking if overnight analysis jobs completed. They didn't.

**12:00 PM** — Lab meeting. A student asks about the analysis pipeline. Nelle doesn't have answers.

**1:00 PM** — Department meeting. Discussion about "research infrastructure." Nelle zones out, thinking about her grant deadline.

**3:00 PM** — Grant writing. Needs budget numbers for computing and storage. Opens a spreadsheet from 2022 and hopes the numbers are still accurate.

**5:00 PM** — Emails hospital IT about HIPAA compliance for her new project. Receives an auto-reply.

**7:00 PM** — Still at her desk. Considers crying. Decides coffee is more practical.

## Current Workarounds

- **Inherited pipeline**: Mika's analysis pipeline works when it works. When it doesn't, Nelle asks other faculty for help.
- **Hospital IT for HIPAA**: The hospital handles compliance, but Nelle doesn't fully understand what they do or whether it's sufficient.
- **Guessing on budgets**: She reuses numbers from previous grants because she doesn't have time to figure out current costs.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Clinical fMRI Study (Alzheimer's Biomarkers) (L3 High)
The main research: using fMRI to identify early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Real patient data, real HIPAA requirements, real IRB oversight.

**Why High tier:** This is clinical research with HIPAA-covered PHI. No question about the tier.

### Project 2: Anonymized Imaging Methods Paper (L1 Low)
A methods paper using fully de-identified data. No patient information, just demonstrating analytical techniques.

**Why Low tier:** Data is completely de-identified. No compliance concerns.

### Project 3: Lab Protocol Documentation (L1 Low) — Storage Only
SOPs, training materials, and internal documentation. Nothing sensitive.

**Why Low tier:** Internal documentation only.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Postdoc | Dr. Arjun Patl | Arrived recently, still learning the systems |
| PhD | Maya Leffson | 3rd year, main person who tries to keep pipeline running |
| PhD | Jonas Brin | 2nd year, clinical focus |
| Masters | Priti Sandoval | Thesis on imaging preprocessing |
| Undergrad | Derek Wolms | Summer volunteer |

**Tech person:** Nobody, really. Maya does her best. The lab desperately needs someone who actually knows what they're doing.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Speed**: Complete the wizard in under 10 minutes.
- **Plain language**: No jargon. Tell her what she needs to know, not everything there is to know.
- **HIPAA guidance**: Clear explanation of what High tier means and what she needs to do.
- **Pre-filled estimates**: Smart defaults based on her project type would save huge time.
- **Printable summary**: Something she can hand to hospital IT to say "this is what I need."

### What would frustrate her?
- **Complexity**: If it takes 30 minutes, she'll abandon it.
- **Jargon**: "Service units," "data residency," "egress charges" — she doesn't have time to Google these.
- **Requiring precision**: If she has to know exact storage needs to the gigabyte, she'll give up.
- **No guidance on compliance**: Telling her data is "High Risk" without explaining what that means is useless.

### Key test scenarios
- **Speed test**: Can she complete the wizard in 10 minutes?
- **HIPAA clarity**: Does she understand what compliance requires after using the tool?
- **Budget generation**: Are the numbers useful for her grant proposal?
- **Low-bandwidth test**: Can she use this on a chaotic day with constant interruptions?

## Quotes

> *"I don't have time to become an IT expert. I need to help my patients. Can this tool just tell me what to do?"*

> *"Wait, it explains what HIPAA means for my storage? In normal words? I might actually understand this."*

> *"This is the first time I've had actual numbers to put in a grant budget. Usually I just guess and hope."*
