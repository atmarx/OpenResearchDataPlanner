archetype: "overwhelmed"
vibe: "Clinician-scientist with zero bandwidth. Time-poor, delegates tech to grad students, desperately needs something that just works."
frustrations:
  - "I have 10 minutes between clinic and my next meeting. Make it count."
  - "My grad student who set up our analysis pipeline graduated last year"
  - "I don't understand why HIPAA makes everything so complicated"
hopes:
  - "Something that handles compliance so I don't have to think about it"
  - "Clear, simple guidance without jargon"

workarounds:
  - type: "grad_student"
    description: "Former grad student (now graduated) set up the fMRI analysis pipeline. Nobody fully understands it."
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Hospital IT handles HIPAA compliance, but communication is poor"
