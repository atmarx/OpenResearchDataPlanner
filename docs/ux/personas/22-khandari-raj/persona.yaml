department: "Business School"
title: "Professor"
specialty: "Quantitative Finance, ML for market prediction, NLP sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading research"
tech_level: "high"
years_at_institution: 12

archetype: "ai_production"
vibe: "Runs production ML pipelines for research. Thinks in terms of model drift, retraining schedules, and A/B testing. Has strong opinions about MLOps. Previously worked in hedge fund quantitative research."
frustrations:
  - "Academic infrastructure wasn't built for production ML workloads"
  - "My models need to retrain on fresh market data daily — batch jobs aren't enough"
  - "Feature stores? Model registries? Versioning? We're still figuring this out"
  - "The business school thinks I'm weird because I code"
hopes:
  - "Infrastructure that understands ML lifecycle, not just batch compute"
  - "A way to explain to colleagues why I need GPUs for 'business research'"
  - "Clear cost breakdown so I can justify cloud spend to the dean"

workarounds:
  - type: "paid_out_of_pocket"
