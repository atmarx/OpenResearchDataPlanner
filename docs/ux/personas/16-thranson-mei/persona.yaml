archetype: "industry_partner"
vibe: "Industry partnerships require IP protection and careful data handling. Wants reproducibility but also needs to protect proprietary methods."
frustrations:
  - "Industry partner provides compute, but coordination is a nightmare"
  - "Balancing open science ideals with IP protection"
  - "Every collaboration has different requirements"
hopes:
  - "Clear budget numbers I can share with industry partners"
  - "A way to plan projects that protects IP while enabling reproducibility"

workarounds:
  - type: "departmental_it"
