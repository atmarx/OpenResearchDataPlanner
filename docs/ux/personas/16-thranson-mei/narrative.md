## Background

Mei Thranson does drug discovery research with industry partners. This means navigating the tension between academic openness and corporate IP protection. Her pharmaceutical company collaborator provides some compute resources, but coordinating between university and company systems is a constant headache.

She believes in reproducibility — her published benchmark datasets are used by researchers worldwide. But she also understands that some methodologies need to be protected, at least temporarily, for the partnership to work. It's a balancing act.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:00 AM** — Call with pharma partner. They want results faster. The compound screening is promising but compute-limited.

**10:00 AM** — Lab meeting. Student presents molecular docking results. The methodology is solid but needs more validation.

**12:00 PM** — Grant writing. NIH proposal requires data sharing plan. Industry partner's lawyer wants to review it first.

**2:00 PM** — Tries to transfer data from company server to university cluster. Security policies make this complicated.

**4:00 PM** — Meeting with tech transfer office about IP protections. More paperwork.

**5:30 PM** — Reviews the benchmark dataset for publication. At least this part is straightforward.

## Current Workarounds

- **Partner compute**: Industry partner provides some HPC access, but coordination is difficult.
- **Lab manager as liaison**: Handles the logistics of moving data between systems.
- **Separate workflows**: Academic and industry projects run on different infrastructure.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Drug-Target Interaction Screening (L2 Medium)
Screening compounds for drug-target interactions using proprietary methodology.

**Why Medium tier:** Industry partnership with IP-sensitive methodology.

### Project 2: NIH R01: Novel Compound Discovery (L2 Medium)
NIH-funded research on novel therapeutic compounds.

**Why Medium tier:** Pre-publication competitive research. Will be open eventually, but not yet.

### Project 3: Published Binding Affinity Dataset (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Benchmark dataset of binding affinities for the research community.

**Why Low tier:** Explicitly published for reproducibility.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Postdoc | Dr. Kenji Yamamoto | Industry project lead |
| PhD | Sarah Mitchell | Molecular docking methods |
| PhD | Alex Chen | Compound screening |
| PhD | Maria Santos | New student, rotation |
| Masters | Jordan Lee | Thesis on binding prediction |
| Undergrad | Tyler Brown | Summer research |

**Tech person:** Lab manager handles coordination between university and partner systems.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Industry partnership recognition**: The tool should understand that some projects have corporate partners.
- **IP protection with reproducibility**: Help balancing open science with necessary protection.
- **Clear budget for partners**: Numbers she can share with industry collaborators.
- **Multiple project tiers**: Different projects have different requirements.

### What would frustrate her?
- **All-or-nothing**: "Either it's open or it's secret" — her world is more nuanced.
- **No industry context**: Academic-only assumptions don't fit her work.
- **Ignoring tech transfer**: IP protection is a legitimate need, not a bad thing.
- **Complex partner coordination**: She already has enough coordination overhead.

### Key test scenarios
- **Industry partnership**: Does the Medium tier explanation make sense for IP protection?
- **Budget documentation**: Can she generate something to share with corporate partners?
- **Reproducibility balance**: Does the tool help her plan for eventual data sharing?
- **Multi-funder complexity**: NIH and industry have different requirements. Does the tool help?

## Quotes

> *"I'm not trying to hide data. I'm trying to protect IP until we can share it properly."*

> *"The budget breakdown is clear enough to share with my industry partner. That saves me a meeting."*

> *"It recognizes that some data can be embargoed now and shared later. That's exactly my situation."*
