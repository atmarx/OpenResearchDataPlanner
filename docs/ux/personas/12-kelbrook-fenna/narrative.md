## Background

Fenna Kelbrook is a data scientist who builds things that people actually use. Her interactive dashboards have been used by state health departments, city planners, and nonprofit organizations. She bridges the gap between academic research and practical tools.

The problem is: there's nowhere to put these tools. Northwinds has no institutional support for research web applications. So Fenna pays for Heroku out of pocket, asks her grad student Amir to handle DevOps, and hopes nothing breaks on the weekend.

She's not bitter about it — she understands that research computing has traditionally meant batch jobs and storage, not web apps. But she wishes someone would recognize that interactive data tools are the future of research impact.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:00 AM** — Checks the public health dashboard. It's running fine. State health department sends a thank-you email.

**9:30 AM** — Meeting with a city planner who wants a custom visualization. Fenna explains she can build it, but hosting is... complicated.

**11:00 AM** — Lab meeting. Students present their projects. Most involve interactive components. All have hosting problems.

**1:00 PM** — Debugging session. The open data toolkit has a memory leak. Amir fixes it while Fenna reviews the code.

**3:00 PM** — Grant writing. Reviewer asked about sustainability plan. "How will the tools be maintained after the grant?" Good question.

**5:00 PM** — Checks Heroku bill. It's creeping up. Considers whether to downgrade the dynos.

## Current Workarounds

- **Personal Heroku account**: Pays for hosting from her discretionary funds. Not sustainable.
- **Amir's DevOps knowledge**: Her PhD student handles deployments. When he graduates, things will break.
- **Hoping for the best**: Not really a plan, but she doesn't have better options.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Public Health Dashboard (State Contract) (L2 Medium)
Interactive dashboard for state health officials tracking disease outbreaks.

**Why Medium tier:** Government contract with pre-release data restrictions.

### Project 2: Open Data Portal Toolkit (L1 Low)
Open source toolkit for building data portals. Used by libraries and nonprofits.

**Why Low tier:** Open source project designed for public use.

### Project 3: Research Data Catalog (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Metadata catalog of research datasets across the university.

**Why Low tier:** Just metadata, no sensitive content.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Amir Rostami | DevOps and infrastructure, everyone depends on him |
| PhD | Jessica Wong | Data visualization specialist |
| PhD | Carlos Mendez | Metadata standards research |
| Masters | Tyler Brooks | Thesis on dashboard usability |
| Undergrad | Priya Sharma | Summer research on accessibility |

**Tech person:** Amir. He's the reason anything stays running. The lab dreads his eventual graduation.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Web hosting options**: Recognition that research outputs include web apps, not just data files.
- **Sustainability guidance**: Help thinking about long-term maintenance.
- **Cost clarity for hosting**: Understanding what it would cost to host institutionally vs. paying out of pocket.
- **Simple deployment paths**: If the tool points to a way to deploy without paying personally, that's huge.

### What would frustrate her?
- **Compute-only focus**: If it's all about HPC and ignores web apps, it misses her use case.
- **No hosting category**: "Where do I put an interactive dashboard?" should have an answer.
- **Storage-only thinking**: She needs uptime, not just bytes.
- **Ignoring maintenance**: Grant-funded projects don't end when the grant ends. Does the tool address this?

### Key test scenarios
- **Web hosting**: Is there a service category for interactive web applications?
- **Hosting costs**: Can she compare institutional options to her current Heroku spend?
- **Sustainability**: Does the output help her answer "what happens after the grant?"
- **Non-traditional use case**: Does the tool accommodate her unusual (for academia) needs?

## Quotes

> *"I'm a data scientist, not a systems administrator. But here I am, managing Heroku deployments because nobody else will host my research tools."*

> *"Wait, there's actually a category for web applications? I assumed the tool was only for batch computing."*

> *"The sustainability section asks about long-term hosting plans. That's exactly what grant reviewers want to know."*
