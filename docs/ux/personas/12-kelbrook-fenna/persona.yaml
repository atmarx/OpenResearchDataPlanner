vibe: "Jack of all trades. Publishes interactive web apps and needs hosting. Frustrated by lack of institutional options for research web applications."
frustrations:
  - "I pay for Heroku out of pocket because there's no institutional hosting option"
  - "My dashboards help public health, but nobody will host them"
  - "Every time I build something useful, the question is 'where will it live?'"
hopes:
  - "Institutional support for research web applications"
  - "A way to publish interactive tools without paying out of pocket"

workarounds:
  - type: "paid_out_of_pocket"
