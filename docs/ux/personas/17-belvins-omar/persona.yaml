specialty: "Large-scale surveys, quantitative methods, R/Stata"
tech_level: "low"
years_at_institution: 11

archetype: "stats_specialist"
vibe: "Statistician who runs massive surveys but isn't compute-focused. R on his laptop, frustrated when analyses take hours. Has FERPA-adjacent student data."
frustrations:
  - "My analyses take 6 hours to run and I don't understand why"
  - "IT keeps telling me to 'use the cluster' but I don't know how"
  - "I'm a statistician, not a computer scientist"
hopes:
  - "Someone to explain in normal words why I might need HPC"
  - "A way to keep my student data secure without a PhD in security"

workarounds:
  - type: "personal_cloud"
    description: "Uses Qualtrics for surveys, stores everything on university OneDrive"
  - type: "grad_student"
    description: "Relies on grad students for any technical work beyond R"
