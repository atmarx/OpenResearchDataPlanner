## At a Glance

| **Tech Level** | Medium |
| **Lab Size** | 4 students |
| **Archetype** | Careful Collaborator |

## Background

Ben Carvallo works at the intersection of academic research and public health practice. His disease models have informed state vaccination strategies and pandemic response plans. He's trusted by government partners because he takes data handling seriously.

The data he works with is technically de-identified — no names, no SSNs, no direct identifiers. But it's aggregated health data that could be sensitive if mishandled. A data breach wouldn't violate HIPAA, but it would destroy his relationships with government partners and potentially reveal information about vulnerable populations.

Ben is careful because he's learned that "de-identified" doesn't mean "not sensitive." The state health department gave him a VPN and a separate workstation specifically because they trust him to be careful.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:00 AM** — Logs into the state health department VPN. Reviews latest disease surveillance data.

**9:30 AM** — Call with state epidemiologist about modeling priorities. They're concerned about a new outbreak.

**11:00 AM** — Research time. Running disease models on the cluster. Results need to be transferred carefully.

**1:00 PM** — Meeting with CDC collaborators about wastewater surveillance project. More data sharing agreements to negotiate.

**3:00 PM** — Writes a data handling memo for his students. Reminds them that de-identified doesn't mean careless.

**4:30 PM** — Reviews a student's analysis before they present it externally. Making sure nothing sensitive slips through.

## Current Workarounds

- **State-provided VPN**: Secure connection for accessing health department data.
- **Dedicated workstation**: Separate computer for sensitive data work.
- **Careful data transfer**: Manual processes for moving results between systems.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: State Health Department Disease Modeling (L2 Medium)
Modeling disease transmission for state public health planning.

**Why Medium tier:** De-identified but sensitive under Data Use Agreement. State would be unhappy if leaked.

### Project 2: CDC Wastewater Surveillance (L2 Medium)
Analyzing wastewater data for population-level health surveillance.

**Why Medium tier:** Government partnership with pre-publication restrictions.

### Project 3: Published COVID Retrospective (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Fully de-identified, published COVID analysis data.

**Why Low tier:** Already published, fully de-identified, no restrictions.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Maria Gonzalez | Disease modeling lead |
| PhD | James Thompson | Wastewater surveillance |
| Masters | Priya Sharma | Thesis on spatial epidemiology |
| Undergrad | Alex Kim | Summer research |

**Tech person:** Ben works closely with public health IT. They've developed a good working relationship.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Medium tier nuance**: Understanding that de-identified data can still be sensitive.
- **DUA acknowledgment**: Recognition that Data Use Agreements create obligations.
- **Documentation for partners**: Output he can share with state and federal collaborators.
- **Government partnership category**: His work doesn't fit neatly into "academic" or "industry."

### What would frustrate him?
- **Binary thinking**: "It's either HIPAA or it's not sensitive" — wrong.
- **No DUA category**: His data has contractual obligations, not just regulatory ones.
- **Assuming all government data is public**: Much of it has pre-publication restrictions.
- **No partner communication support**: He needs to explain data handling to non-academics.

### Key test scenarios
- **Medium tier for de-identified**: Does the tool understand that de-identified can be Medium?
- **DUA recognition**: Is there acknowledgment of Data Use Agreement obligations?
- **Partner documentation**: Can he generate something to share with government collaborators?
- **Nuanced tier selection**: Can he explain to the tool why it's Medium, not Low?

## Quotes

> *"It's de-identified, but the state health department trusts me with this data. I'm not going to betray that trust."*

> *"The Medium tier description mentions Data Use Agreements. Finally, someone who understands."*

> *"I can export this summary for my state partners. That's going to save me hours of explanation."*
