archetype: "careful_collaborator"
vibe: "Works with state health departments. Careful with de-identified data. Understands that 'de-identified' doesn't mean 'not sensitive.'"
frustrations:
  - "Everyone thinks de-identified means we can do whatever we want. It doesn't."
  - "Government partners have their own requirements on top of ours"
  - "Data sharing agreements take 6 months to negotiate"
hopes:
  - "A tool that understands the nuance of de-identified but still sensitive data"
  - "Clear documentation for my government partners"

workarounds:
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "State gave him a VPN and separate workstation"
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Works closely with public health IT on secure data transfer"
