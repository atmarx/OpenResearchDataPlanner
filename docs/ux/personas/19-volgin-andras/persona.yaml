vibe: "Frustrated that his Stata and Excel macros don't scale. Policy-focused researcher who needs bigger compute but doesn't want to become a programmer."
frustrations:
  - "My Stata code runs for 3 days on my desktop. This can't be right."
  - "I know there's a better way but I don't have time to learn it"
  - "Python keeps coming up but I've been using Stata for 20 years"
hopes:
  - "A way to run my existing code faster without rewriting everything"
  - "Someone who speaks economics, not just computer science"

workarounds:
  - type: "custom_scripts"
