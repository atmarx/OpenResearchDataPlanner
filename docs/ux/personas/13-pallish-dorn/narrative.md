## Background

Dorn Pallish is a medieval historian who stumbled into digital humanities. His research on manuscript transmission requires analyzing patterns across tens of thousands of documents — more than any human could read in a lifetime. So he learned, reluctantly, about text analysis and NLP.

He's not a programmer. He doesn't want to be a programmer. He just wants to answer historical questions, and sometimes that requires computational tools. The problem is that everyone in research computing speaks a language he doesn't understand. What's a "service unit"? Why can't he just use Dropbox? What's wrong with his laptop?

Dorn is curious and willing to learn, but he needs someone to meet him where he is.

## A Day in Their Life

**9:00 AM** — Arrives with coffee. Checks email. A collaborator asks about their "computational pipeline." Dorn pretends to understand.

**10:00 AM** — Research time. Manually reviewing manuscript transcriptions. This is the work he loves.

**12:00 PM** — Meeting with CS colleague about NLP tools. Understands about 40% of what's said. Nods politely.

**2:00 PM** — Teaching. DH Methods seminar. Students ask about computing resources. Dorn deflects with "we'll figure that out."

**4:00 PM** — Tries to upload a large corpus to Dropbox. It fails. He doesn't know why.

**5:00 PM** — Emails the library about archive access. At least that's a problem he understands.

## Current Workarounds

- **Personal Dropbox**: Most of his data lives there. He doesn't understand why this is supposedly bad.
- **Technically-minded grad student**: When computation is needed, he relies on students who know more than he does.
- **Avoiding the problem**: For really big computational tasks, he collaborates with CS faculty and lets them handle it.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Medieval Manuscript Corpus Analysis (L1 Low)
Analyzing linguistic patterns across thousands of medieval manuscripts using NLP.

**Why Low tier:** Public domain historical texts. No sensitivity concerns.

### Project 2: Oral History Transcription Archive (L2 Medium) — Storage Only
Interviews with elderly community members about local history. Some privacy concerns.

**Why Medium tier:** Interview subjects requested privacy. Not regulated, but ethically sensitive.

### Project 3: DH Methods Course Materials (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Teaching materials for his digital humanities seminar.

**Why Low tier:** Teaching resources, nothing sensitive.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Sarah Mitchell | Corpus linguistics, knows Python |
| PhD | James O'Brien | Traditional philology, learning digital methods |
| Undergrad | Emily Chen | Summer research, tech-savvy |

**Tech person:** Sarah knows Python and tries to help. Dorn appreciates her patience.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Plain language**: No jargon. Or if jargon is necessary, explain it.
- **Guidance for non-experts**: "What is a service unit?" should have an answer.
- **Realistic defaults**: Smart suggestions based on his project type.
- **No condescension**: Meeting him where he is doesn't mean talking down to him.

### What would frustrate him?
- **Acronym soup**: "SU," "TB," "DUA," "IRB" — without explanation, he's lost.
- **Assuming technical knowledge**: "Select your compute partition" — he doesn't know what that means.
- **Too many options**: Overwhelming choices make him freeze.
- **Gatekeeping language**: Making him feel stupid for not knowing things.

### Key test scenarios
- **Plain language**: Is every term either explained or linkable to an explanation?
- **Smart defaults**: Can he get through the wizard with mostly default values?
- **Help text quality**: When he's confused, is help actually helpful?
- **Accessibility for non-experts**: Does the tool work for someone who's not in STEM?

## Quotes

> *"What is a 'service unit'? Is that like a dollar? A kilowatt-hour? A prayer?"*

> *"Oh, there's a tooltip that explains what that means. And it's in normal words. Thank you."*

> *"I clicked 'suggest for me' and it proposed reasonable defaults. I don't have to pretend to understand things I don't."*
