archetype: "curious_humanist"
vibe: "A historian with digital tools. Not a programmer, but genuinely curious. Has massive text corpora and no idea how to process them efficiently."
frustrations:
  - "I don't understand why I can't just use Google Drive for my research"

hopes:
  - "Plain language explanations of what I need"
  - "Someone to meet me where I am, not where they think I should be"
