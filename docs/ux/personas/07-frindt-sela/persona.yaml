name: "Dr. Sela Frindt"
department: "Biomedical Engineering"
title: "Associate Professor"
specialty: "Medical device simulation, ANSYS/SolidWorks, FDA regulatory pathway"
tech_level: "medium"
years_at_institution: 9

archetype: "compliance_juggler"
vibe: "Constantly navigating FDA requirements, hospital partnerships, and industry NDAs. Juggles multiple compliance frameworks simultaneously."
frustrations:
  - "Every project has different compliance requirements and I can never remember which is which"
  - "Industry wants one thing, FDA wants another, hospital wants a third"
  - "I spend more time on paperwork than on actual research"
hopes:
  - "A tool that helps me track which data needs which protections"
  - "Clear documentation I can show to auditors"

workarounds:
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Hospital IT gave her a separate workstation for patient data"
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Elaborate spreadsheet system to track which project needs which compliance"
