| **Archetype** | Compliance Juggler |

## Background

Sela Frindt works at the intersection of engineering, medicine, and regulation — which means she spends an enormous amount of time on paperwork. Her research on cardiac stents could save lives, but first she has to navigate FDA 510(k) requirements, hospital IRB protocols, industry NDAs, and HIPAA compliance. Sometimes all for the same project.

She's developed an elaborate spreadsheet system to track which project needs which compliance framework. It works, mostly, but she lives in fear of an audit revealing something she missed.

The hospital gave her a separate workstation for patient data, which is great for security but terrible for workflow. She's constantly moving between systems, trying to remember what can go where.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:00 AM** — Checks email. FDA reviewer has questions about the stent simulation methodology. More documentation needed.

**9:30 AM** — Hospital meeting. New IRB protocol for the implant analysis project. More forms to fill out.

**11:00 AM** — Industry call. They want progress on the simulation, but some results can't be shared due to hospital data restrictions.

**1:00 PM** — Lab meeting. Student asks which server to upload data to. Sela has to think hard about which project this is for and what the restrictions are.

**3:00 PM** — Works on the HIPAA workstation. Can't access her notes from her regular computer.

**4:30 PM** — Updates her compliance spreadsheet. Hopes she hasn't missed anything.

## Current Workarounds

- **Hospital workstation**: A dedicated machine for HIPAA data. Secure but isolated.
- **Compliance spreadsheet**: Color-coded Excel file tracking which project has which requirements.
- **Mental partitioning**: Sela has trained herself to think about each project in its own compliance context.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Cardiac Stent Simulation (FDA Submission) (L3 High)
Simulations supporting an FDA 510(k) submission for a new cardiac stent design. Regulatory requirements are extensive and specific.

**Why High tier:** FDA regulatory submission. All data must meet FDA record-keeping requirements.

### Project 2: Hospital Collaboration: Implant Analysis (L3 High)
Using patient imaging data to analyze implant performance. Full HIPAA applies.

**Why High tier:** HIPAA-covered patient data. No ambiguity here.

### Project 3: Undergraduate Design Competition Archive (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Archive of student capstone projects from the annual design competition. No sensitive data.

**Why Low tier:** Student work, no IP concerns, no compliance requirements.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Jason Kellmore | 4th year, handles ANSYS licensing headaches |
| PhD | Miriam Sondel | 3rd year, FDA project lead |
| PhD | Raul Quintero | 2nd year, hospital collaboration |
| Masters | Anna Petrova | Thesis on simulation validation |
| Undergrad | Derek Williams | Senior design project |

**Tech person:** Jason handles software licensing issues, which is half the battle. For compliance, Sela is on her own.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Clear tier explanations**: "High tier means X, Y, Z requirements" — spelled out clearly.
- **Multiple projects, multiple tiers**: Easy to switch between projects with different requirements.
- **Compliance documentation**: Output she can show to FDA, hospital IRB, or industry partners.
- **Retention tracking**: Different projects have different retention requirements.

### What would frustrate her?
- **One-size-fits-all**: If the tool assumes all projects are the same tier, it's useless.
- **No regulatory context**: "High Risk" without explaining what that means for FDA/HIPAA.
- **Complicated switching**: If going between L1 and L3 projects is clunky, she'll give up.
- **No audit trail**: She needs to prove she made the right choices.

### Key test scenarios
- **Multi-tier workflow**: Can she easily manage L1, L3, L3 projects in one session?
- **Compliance clarity**: Does she understand what High tier means for FDA vs. HIPAA?
- **Documentation output**: Is the DMP output useful for regulatory purposes?
- **Retention complexity**: Different projects have different retention periods. Does the tool handle this?

## Quotes

> *"I have three projects with three different compliance frameworks. Please tell me this tool understands that."*

> *"Oh, I can select different retention requirements for different projects? This is already better than my spreadsheet."*

> *"The output explains why it's High tier? I can literally attach this to my FDA submission. Thank you."*
