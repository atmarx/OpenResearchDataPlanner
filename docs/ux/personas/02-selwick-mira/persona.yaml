department: "Chemistry"
title: "Associate Professor"
specialty: "Quantum chemistry, computational catalysis, Gaussian/ORCA"
tech_level: "medium"
years_at_institution: 8

archetype: "detail_oriented"
vibe: "Meticulous and methodical. Worries about data provenance and reproducibility. Frustrated by license management chaos."
frustrations:
  - "I can never get a straight answer on how much Gaussian licenses cost"
  - "Our data organization is a mess — I can't reproduce results from 2019"
  - "Industry collaborators want documentation I don't have time to create"
hopes:
  - "A clear budget breakdown I can show to collaborators"
  - "Better organization for long-term data management"

workarounds:
  - type: "paid_out_of_pocket"
    description: "Pays for Gaussian licenses out of grant funds, unclear if institutional licenses exist"
  - type: "departmental_it"
    description: "Relies on chemistry IT for cluster access but communication is spotty"
