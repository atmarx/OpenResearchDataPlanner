## Background

Mira Selwick earned her PhD at MIT and did a postdoc at Stanford before joining Northwinds eight years ago. She's known for meticulous, reproducible computational work — her papers always include complete methodological details, and she's a vocal advocate for open science in chemistry.

The irony isn't lost on her that she can't reproduce some of her own lab's results from 2019 because the data is scattered across three different grad students' laptops (two of whom have graduated) and a chemistry department server that nobody remembers the password for.

Her biggest professional frustration is license management. She runs Gaussian, ORCA, and occasionally VASP, and she genuinely has no idea how much any of this costs or whether the university has site licenses. Every time she asks, she gets a different answer.

## A Day in Their Life

**8:30 AM** — Arrives early to catch up on email before the chaos starts. Industry collaborator needs a progress report by Friday.

**10:00 AM** — Research meeting. Reviews DFT calculations with her grad student. The numbers look wrong — did someone change the basis set?

**11:30 AM** — Tries to find the original input files from their 2019 paper. Can't locate them. Spends 45 minutes searching.

**1:00 PM** — Teaching. CHEM 540, Computational Methods. Students ask about software access and she honestly doesn't know the answer.

**3:00 PM** — Administrative email. Needs to submit budget for next year's NSF supplement. How much does Gaussian actually cost?

**5:30 PM** — Gives up on finding the 2019 files. Asks a student to re-run the calculations, feeling defeated.

## Current Workarounds

- **License confusion**: Pays for Gaussian out of grant funds because she's not sure if institutional licenses exist. Might be paying twice.
- **Scattered data**: Files live on student laptops, department servers, and her office workstation. No central repository.
- **Manual documentation**: Creates detailed README files for every project, but they get out of date quickly.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Catalytic Reaction Pathway Modeling (L2 Medium)
An industry collaboration to model catalytic reaction pathways for green chemistry applications. The work is under NDA, and the company has specific data handling requirements.

**Why Medium tier:** Industry NDA with IP-sensitive methodology. Not regulated, but definitely proprietary.

### Project 2: Published Benchmark Dataset Repository (L1 Low) — Storage Only
A repository of benchmark calculations that she's publishing for the computational chemistry community. Completely open, designed for reproducibility.

**Why Low tier:** Explicitly public data. The whole point is for others to use it.

### Project 3: Graduate Student Training Calculations (L1 Low)
Practice calculations for new students learning the methods. Nothing sensitive, relatively low compute needs.

**Why Low tier:** Training and teaching. No IP concerns.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Postdoc | Dr. Kenj Yamamoto | Senior lab member, manages day-to-day |
| PhD | Maria Santov | 4th year, lead on industry project |
| PhD | Ahm Hassani | 3rd year, benchmark dataset work |
| PhD | Lisa Chenn | 1st year, still learning methods |
| Undergrad | Tyler Johanson | Honors thesis on simple systems |

**Tech person:** Nobody. Chemistry IT is understaffed and doesn't really understand computational chemistry needs. Mira often ends up debugging cluster issues herself.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make her happy?
- **Clear cost breakdown**: Finally knowing what software and compute actually costs.
- **Organization help**: Any guidance on data organization and retention.
- **Documentation output**: Something she can show to collaborators when they ask about data handling.
- **License clarity**: If the tool knows about institutional licenses, that would be amazing.

### What would frustrate her?
- **Vague pricing**: "Contact us for a quote" — she wants numbers.
- **No data management guidance**: Just computing costs isn't enough.
- **Assuming she knows infrastructure details**: She knows chemistry, not IT systems.
- **Missing software options**: If Gaussian isn't in the service catalog, she'll be confused.

### Key test scenarios
- **Industry collaboration**: Does the Medium tier explanation make sense for NDA work?
- **Cost clarity**: Can she finally get a clear answer on compute costs?
- **Data retention**: Does the tool help her think about long-term data preservation?
- **Software licensing**: Is there any integration with license management?

## Quotes

> *"I'm a chemist, not a systems administrator. I just want to know: how much does this cost and where does my data live?"*

> *"Oh, it actually breaks down the storage costs separately from compute? That's... really helpful for the budget."*

> *"Wait, there's a section on data retention? This is exactly what my NSF program officer keeps asking about."*
