specialty: "Machine Learning, GPU clusters, Kubernetes, large language models"
tech_level: "very_high"
years_at_institution: 5

archetype: "cluster_breaker"
vibe: "The one who breaks the cluster. Needs GPUs, spot instances, preemptible compute. Knows more about infrastructure than most IT staff."
frustrations:
  - "The cluster doesn't have enough GPUs and everyone's competing for them"
  - "I can't burst to cloud without going through 3 months of procurement"
  - "The scavenger queue is great but I need guaranteed compute for deadlines"
hopes:
  - "A way to mix scavenger/preemptible compute with on-demand for flexibility"
  - "Cost transparency so I can make intelligent tradeoffs"

workarounds:
  - type: "paid_out_of_pocket"
    description: "Has a personal AWS account for burst compute when deadlines loom"
  - type: "custom_scripts"
    description: "Elaborate job scheduling system to maximize scavenger queue usage"
