archetype: "closet_nas"
vibe: "Practical, no-nonsense engineer. Just needs it to work. Has a NAS in his office closet connected to daisy-chained power strips and knows this is a disaster waiting to happen."
frustrations:
  - "I know my closet NAS is a fire hazard. I just haven't had time to fix it."
  - "Every time I ask IT for alternatives, they give me a form and a 6-month timeline"
  - "I'm an engineer. I can solve problems. But not bureaucracy."
hopes:
  - "A legitimate solution that doesn't require 47 meetings"
  - "Someone who will just tell me what to do and how much it costs"

workarounds:
  - type: "closet_nas"
    description: "Consumer NAS in office closet, connected to 3 daisy-chained power strips"
  - type: "grad_student"
    description: "Previous student set up the NAS, current students maintain it poorly"
