## Background

Rab Tonkling is a practical engineer with no patience for bureaucracy. He solves problems for a living — his research on seismic retrofit has literally saved buildings from collapse. But the one problem he hasn't solved is his own data storage situation.

There's a consumer NAS in his office closet. It's connected to three daisy-chained power strips (a clear fire code violation). It was set up by a grad student five years ago, runs some version of Linux nobody remembers, and contains irreplaceable simulation data. Rab knows this is a disaster waiting to happen.

Every time he asks IT for an alternative, they give him a form, a 6-month timeline, and a bunch of questions he doesn't know how to answer. So the NAS stays in the closet, humming ominously.

## A Day in Their Life

**7:30 AM** — Arrives to find the closet NAS has restarted overnight for unknown reasons. Data seems fine. Probably.

**9:00 AM** — Meeting with State DOT about the bridge retrofit project. They want simulations by next month.

**11:00 AM** — Runs structural analysis. Job submitted to the cluster, but results will need to be copied to... the closet NAS.

**1:00 PM** — Student meeting. They need access to last year's simulation data. The NAS takes 20 minutes to respond.

**3:00 PM** — Email from facilities about fire safety inspection next week. Rab looks at the power strips. Sighs.

**4:00 PM** — Tries to submit a ticket to IT for storage help. The form asks 15 questions he doesn't know how to answer. Closes the form.

**5:00 PM** — Goes home. The NAS is still humming.

## Current Workarounds

- **Closet NAS**: Consumer hardware in the office closet. Works, mostly. Fire hazard.
- **Daisy-chained power strips**: Three of them. Definitely not up to code.
- **Hoping for the best**: Rab's primary data protection strategy.

## Their Projects

### Project 1: Seismic Retrofit Analysis (State DOT) (L2 Medium)
Simulations for a state department of transportation contract on bridge retrofit strategies.

**Why Medium tier:** Government contract with pre-publication restrictions.

### Project 2: Bridge Sensor Network Analysis (L2 Medium)
Analyzing real-time sensor data from bridges. Infrastructure security concerns.

**Why Medium tier:** Unpublished sensor data with infrastructure security implications.

### Project 3: Historical Earthquake Data Repository (L1 Low) — Storage Only
Public USGS earthquake data for research reference.

**Why Low tier:** All public domain data from federal sources.

## The Lab

| Role | Name | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| PhD | Minori Tsukuda | 4th year, DOT project lead |
| PhD | Brian Holloway | 2nd year, sensor network analysis |
| Masters | Aleksi Virtanen | Thesis on dynamic response |
| Undergrad | Maria Gonzalez | Summer research |

**Tech person:** Nobody. The previous student who set up the NAS graduated. Current students are afraid to touch it.

## Using OpenResearchDataPlanner

### What would make him happy?
- **Simple answers**: "You need X, it costs Y, here's the form." Done.
- **Migration path**: A way to get data OFF the closet NAS.
- **No bureaucracy**: If using this tool requires 47 meetings, he'll keep the NAS.
- **Engineering-speak**: Storage in TB, not marketing nonsense.

### What would frustrate him?
- **Complexity**: If the wizard is complicated, he'll close it.
- **Jargon he doesn't know**: "Data residency requirements" — what does that mean?
- **No clear next steps**: "Contact us for more information" is useless.
- **Ignoring existing data**: He has terabytes on that NAS. The tool should help migrate, not just plan new storage.

### Key test scenarios
- **Simplicity test**: Can he understand the output without IT help?
- **Migration scenario**: Can he plan to move data from the closet NAS?
- **Budget justification**: Does he get numbers he can show to his department head?
- **Speed**: Under 10 minutes or he's out.

## Quotes

> *"Look, I'm an engineer. Just tell me: what do I need, how much does it cost, and when can I stop worrying about that NAS catching fire?"*

> *"Wait, I can actually migrate my existing data to this? Not just new projects?"*

> *"This is the first time anyone has given me a straight answer about storage. I'm almost suspicious."*
