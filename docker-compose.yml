# Docker Compose for OpenResearchDataPlanner
#
# For institutions deploying their own instance:
# 1. Copy config/ to ./my-config/
# 2. Edit files in ./my-config/ with your institution's info
# 3. Run: docker-compose up --build
#
# The config is baked into the image at build time.
# To update config, rebuild: docker-compose up --build
